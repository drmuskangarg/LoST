1,You guys ever watch a cartoon like adventure Time and fall extremely deep into the stories and realize that the stories that the show tells are more interesting than your life... Or that the characters have more personality. Like is it just me? I fall in love with the plot and I'm emotionally drained but in a good way but then at the end I just wanna die thinking how sick it'd be to not be alive or just be in somewhere where I'm appreciated and have friends.,0
2,"Is it? Successful people are usually strong physically and mentally, and I am neither.",1
3,"I hate myself, i hate everything I am. I wish I didn't. Or maybe I really don't. Maybe I just can't take the negative thoughts, the pain, the apathy, the endless battle you can never win anymore. I feel like I'm worthless, like I mean nothing to anyone. I'm always trying to live up to impossible expectations from a person that doesn't exist. I hurt, and hurt, and hurt and hurt so much that my heart may as well explode and nothing changes. I go to bed, I wake up the next day and repeat that for however long I get to till I'm back here. Knowing that there will never be a point where I don't come back here till the day I die. Why don't I get to be normal? Why don't I get to be happy without the looming sadness and anger? What did I do to deserve this? Is it because I exist? Not letting me live wasn't enough punishment. I had to be cursed to live a life where I wake up everyday hating myself more and more and more till the white noise becomes a ringing that becomes banging in my head screaming ""YOU ARE WORTHLESS"" in a mask of my own voice. I just want to be free of this curse.",1
4,I really don't know what to do all I want to do right now is just sit alone with no one around me and just cry like why does life have to be this terrible why and why did this have to happen to me why am I only so dumb so stupid and just useless I don't want to be like this i hate it but i don't know what to do,1
5,"I know this is cliches being tired and unable to sleep. I‚Äôm unwell, and I can‚Äôt sleep because of this horrible headache and rating thoughts. I know it‚Äôs a typical depression symptoms. It just really sucks, I‚Äôm sure most of you can relate.",0
6,"Hi guys i really really want to die but every time i want to do it i think about all the people who would be sad about me killing myself. I'm 23 *5 ft 7 * Receding hair * Gotten ugly (used to be very handsome and have women constantly flirt with me) * I got fired from my job * I've destroyed my brain through abusing internet/video games - can no longer think anymore. * I've blown all my money on gambling and prostitutes * I have a terrible OCD/body dismorphia problem that makes me obsessed with working out / eating healthy (to the point that it is damaging my life + * This has made me lost the majority of my friends) * I've never had a gf * i'm also pretty bad socially, often quiet and shy (Social anxiety) I want to just kill myself Everyday I have thoughts saying just do it, do it, i want to die. Just do it. But it's so hard for me. e.g. i have a 13 year old cousin (Single child) who looks up to me and thinks i'm the boss. If i kill myself how would he feel? what am i supposed to do?",1
7,"Tonight I was just thinking about everything I could do to just...stop. But I basically just worked up the little bit of courage I had and I finally called. My anxiety was all over the place and I was constantly having panic attacks about it but, I finally did it. It honestly feels weird to be happy though. Even if I should be feeling proud of myself and all it just feels weird to feel happy. But it felt so good to have someone understand everything I told them, and not just shrug it off and act like it's just because of my age or ""just how I am"" because of my past or anxiety getting to me. It feels so nice to have someone actually understand me for once, and understand what's happening, and how my situation is. We talked for about 40 minutes and she had a really strong accent but, it was nice. My anxiety eventually faded away, and she helped more than my own family could. I finally feel happy though, and that's all that matters to me right now.",0
8,"These thoughts cause havoc upon my being. Whenever I am not working or sleeping, these thoughts sneak into my consciousness and I would feel futile and pointless - that there is no point of trying anymore because I would never become what or whom I thought I would or could have been. It doesn‚Äôt even matter that I know, heart of hearts, that even without depression I would have been a loser anyway. I am accustomed to blaming it for all the failures, disappointments and misery in life. I guess this justify my expensive bills from my shrink. At least I no longer spent the night tossing and turning in bed thinking. I take my meds and sleep will come.",1
9,"I've been here for eight years. On and off. Don't look here if you want to get better, it's just a place for loners to feel lonelier. Break free through actions, write, read, jump, fly. Fuck this hole...",0
10,This may seem irrelevant to depression but I‚Äôm looking for people who are gamers and have any of the platforms I ask because I‚Äôve been trying to find decent friends and I would like to start trying again I haven‚Äôt had any luck t doesn‚Äôt have to be gaming related just preferred I I just would like to find decent friends,0
11,There is nothing good going on in my life. It's just full of stress and misery. It's becoming clearer by the day what best option is.,0
12,"There's nothing I want to do, I don't enjoy anything anymore, so I just occupy myself with meaningless bullshit to help the time pass. It makes life feel so pointless.",0
13,I better stop being a coward and end it. I‚Äôm scared that a gunshot wound won‚Äôt be fast enough and I don‚Äôt have any bitcoin so I can‚Äôt order the right drugs online. But whatever. Even if it hurts this has to be the year I get the strength,1
14,I wish there was something to fight for other than a paycheck at the end of the month. Life feels so meaningless.,0
15,"How do you talk to people about depression, either about your own or theirs? Do/don'ts?",0
16,I'm boring. I'm not good at socializing and I'm very awkward. I'm replaceable. I'm undesirable. I'm not attractive. I'm retarded. I hate myself so much. I push people away with my insecurities. Fuck I want to die so much right now.,1
17,"I've already broken all of mine. I wanted to start keeping a journal. Nope didn't happen. Wanted to start drawing more, didn't happen either. I've become worse and just lie in bed all day now. I just wanted to become a better person.",1
18,"I talk a lot, fairly flippantly usually, because that's what you do when you've had depression your whole life I guess, about hating myself, but I was just thinking about it, and I don't think I actually do. (This is not a positive post, by the way, this like... gets worse from here, my head is in a super bad place and I really somewhere to vent where no-one irl is gonna see it. Just a warning.) See I think hating or loathing someone takes this huge amount of energy. You have to be conscious about it. I think that's why it's not unusual for someone who really hates them self to also be pretty narcissistic. But for me, it's not a big effort. I don't hate myself, I just.. don't like myself. It's kind of like, when you have a group of friends, and there's one person in the group and you just don't get why anyone likes them. It's not mean-spirited, necessarily, you just don't find them interesting, or funny, or smart. They're not good-looking enough for you to think that that's why people still seem to like them. And you don't think about it all the time, maybe, but it bugs you. You find yourself rolling your eyes when they talk. When they're at events you're like ""seriously? who invited them?"" But when they're not around, you don't even think of them. They don't take up enough of your notice- they aren't remarkable enough- for you to devote any extra thought to. And I guess if I could sum that up in a word, that's how I feel about myself.",1
19,"I'm really rock-bottom at the moment. I'm seeking therapy, I have great friends and family who I hear from every few days, but no matter what: I feel isolated and I just don't want to bother anyone. Desperate for human contact, feeling included, loved, etc. Is this reasonable? Should I reach out to some friends, even though I am in constant need for that kind of interaction at the moment? I just can't stand being alone.",0
20,So 2018 started and everything feels the same. I'm still depressed. I'm constantly thinking about suicide and I'm steadily losing people whom I can talk to. My life is without purpose. I wish I could end it.,0
