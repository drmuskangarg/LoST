You guys ever watch a cartoon like adventure Time and fall extremely deep into the stories and realize that the stories that the show tells are more interesting than your life... Or that the characters have more personality. Like is it just me? I fall in love with the plot and I'm emotionally drained but in a good way but then at the end I just wanna die thinking how sick it'd be to not be alive or just be in somewhere where I'm appreciated and have friends.,0
"Is it? Successful people are usually strong physically and mentally, and I am neither.",1
"I hate myself, i hate everything I am. I wish I didn't. Or maybe I really don't. Maybe I just can't take the negative thoughts, the pain, the apathy, the endless battle you can never win anymore. I feel like I'm worthless, like I mean nothing to anyone. I'm always trying to live up to impossible expectations from a person that doesn't exist. I hurt, and hurt, and hurt and hurt so much that my heart may as well explode and nothing changes. I go to bed, I wake up the next day and repeat that for however long I get to till I'm back here. Knowing that there will never be a point where I don't come back here till the day I die. Why don't I get to be normal? Why don't I get to be happy without the looming sadness and anger? What did I do to deserve this? Is it because I exist? Not letting me live wasn't enough punishment. I had to be cursed to live a life where I wake up everyday hating myself more and more and more till the white noise becomes a ringing that becomes banging in my head screaming ""YOU ARE WORTHLESS"" in a mask of my own voice. I just want to be free of this curse.",1
I really don't know what to do all I want to do right now is just sit alone with no one around me and just cry like why does life have to be this terrible why and why did this have to happen to me why am I only so dumb so stupid and just useless I don't want to be like this i hate it but i don't know what to do,1
"I know this is cliches being tired and unable to sleep. I‚Äôm unwell, and I can‚Äôt sleep because of this horrible headache and rating thoughts. I know it‚Äôs a typical depression symptoms. It just really sucks, I‚Äôm sure most of you can relate.",0
"Hi guys i really really want to die but every time i want to do it i think about all the people who would be sad about me killing myself. I'm 23 *5 ft 7 * Receding hair * Gotten ugly (used to be very handsome and have women constantly flirt with me) * I got fired from my job * I've destroyed my brain through abusing internet/video games - can no longer think anymore. * I've blown all my money on gambling and prostitutes * I have a terrible OCD/body dismorphia problem that makes me obsessed with working out / eating healthy (to the point that it is damaging my life + * This has made me lost the majority of my friends) * I've never had a gf * i'm also pretty bad socially, often quiet and shy (Social anxiety) I want to just kill myself Everyday I have thoughts saying just do it, do it, i want to die. Just do it. But it's so hard for me. e.g. i have a 13 year old cousin (Single child) who looks up to me and thinks i'm the boss. If i kill myself how would he feel? what am i supposed to do?",1
"Tonight I was just thinking about everything I could do to just...stop. But I basically just worked up the little bit of courage I had and I finally called. My anxiety was all over the place and I was constantly having panic attacks about it but, I finally did it. It honestly feels weird to be happy though. Even if I should be feeling proud of myself and all it just feels weird to feel happy. But it felt so good to have someone understand everything I told them, and not just shrug it off and act like it's just because of my age or ""just how I am"" because of my past or anxiety getting to me. It feels so nice to have someone actually understand me for once, and understand what's happening, and how my situation is. We talked for about 40 minutes and she had a really strong accent but, it was nice. My anxiety eventually faded away, and she helped more than my own family could. I finally feel happy though, and that's all that matters to me right now.",0
"These thoughts cause havoc upon my being. Whenever I am not working or sleeping, these thoughts sneak into my consciousness and I would feel futile and pointless - that there is no point of trying anymore because I would never become what or whom I thought I would or could have been. It doesn‚Äôt even matter that I know, heart of hearts, that even without depression I would have been a loser anyway. I am accustomed to blaming it for all the failures, disappointments and misery in life. I guess this justify my expensive bills from my shrink. At least I no longer spent the night tossing and turning in bed thinking. I take my meds and sleep will come.",1
"I've been here for eight years. On and off. Don't look here if you want to get better, it's just a place for loners to feel lonelier. Break free through actions, write, read, jump, fly. Fuck this hole...",0
This may seem irrelevant to depression but I‚Äôm looking for people who are gamers and have any of the platforms I ask because I‚Äôve been trying to find decent friends and I would like to start trying again I haven‚Äôt had any luck t doesn‚Äôt have to be gaming related just preferred I I just would like to find decent friends,0
There is nothing good going on in my life. It's just full of stress and misery. It's becoming clearer by the day what best option is.,0
"There's nothing I want to do, I don't enjoy anything anymore, so I just occupy myself with meaningless bullshit to help the time pass. It makes life feel so pointless.",0
I better stop being a coward and end it. I‚Äôm scared that a gunshot wound won‚Äôt be fast enough and I don‚Äôt have any bitcoin so I can‚Äôt order the right drugs online. But whatever. Even if it hurts this has to be the year I get the strength,1
I wish there was something to fight for other than a paycheck at the end of the month. Life feels so meaningless.,0
"How do you talk to people about depression, either about your own or theirs? Do/don'ts?",0
I'm boring. I'm not good at socializing and I'm very awkward. I'm replaceable. I'm undesirable. I'm not attractive. I'm retarded. I hate myself so much. I push people away with my insecurities. Fuck I want to die so much right now.,1
"I've already broken all of mine. I wanted to start keeping a journal. Nope didn't happen. Wanted to start drawing more, didn't happen either. I've become worse and just lie in bed all day now. I just wanted to become a better person.",1
"I talk a lot, fairly flippantly usually, because that's what you do when you've had depression your whole life I guess, about hating myself, but I was just thinking about it, and I don't think I actually do. (This is not a positive post, by the way, this like... gets worse from here, my head is in a super bad place and I really somewhere to vent where no-one irl is gonna see it. Just a warning.) See I think hating or loathing someone takes this huge amount of energy. You have to be conscious about it. I think that's why it's not unusual for someone who really hates them self to also be pretty narcissistic. But for me, it's not a big effort. I don't hate myself, I just.. don't like myself. It's kind of like, when you have a group of friends, and there's one person in the group and you just don't get why anyone likes them. It's not mean-spirited, necessarily, you just don't find them interesting, or funny, or smart. They're not good-looking enough for you to think that that's why people still seem to like them. And you don't think about it all the time, maybe, but it bugs you. You find yourself rolling your eyes when they talk. When they're at events you're like ""seriously? who invited them?"" But when they're not around, you don't even think of them. They don't take up enough of your notice- they aren't remarkable enough- for you to devote any extra thought to. And I guess if I could sum that up in a word, that's how I feel about myself.",1
"I'm really rock-bottom at the moment. I'm seeking therapy, I have great friends and family who I hear from every few days, but no matter what: I feel isolated and I just don't want to bother anyone. Desperate for human contact, feeling included, loved, etc. Is this reasonable? Should I reach out to some friends, even though I am in constant need for that kind of interaction at the moment? I just can't stand being alone.",0
So 2018 started and everything feels the same. I'm still depressed. I'm constantly thinking about suicide and I'm steadily losing people whom I can talk to. My life is without purpose. I wish I could end it.,0
Don't even have the energy to do that. Why the fuck am I like this. How did I get here. Why the fuck can't I be okay.,0
"Look I'm not that depressed. I have mild depression. But . I don't feel alive. I can feel the wind and rain and I can see the hills and the windmills but I can't FEEL them. It's like they aren't there it's like I'm not there. I feel this emotion inside of me that wants to get out but I don't know how. I've been numb for so long and I think a lot of people are they just ignore it. I don't want to ignore it, I want to be alive again. There's this fog in my head that I can't get through. I feel like meds and doctors can't help because they are stuck in the same fog but they just don't know they are. They want to label it different things and give it names but this is something only I can help myself get through. Anyone else feel this way?",0
"I don't even know how I feel, I think I might be sad, but even then I usually know when I'm sad. Right now I've just felt numb and disconnected for a few days. I have a girlfriend who loves me, awesome friends, a relatively low stress life, and I even have creative outlets. But, recently (like a week), I haven't been able to write anything, I haven't talked to any of my friends, and I have a ton of trouble even talking with my girlfriend because... I don't even fucking know, I don't know why any of this is like it is. I want to write, I want to write all the time, but I just goddamn can't. I want to talk to my friends and hang out with them but I just fucking don't. I want to be with my girlfriend and hold her and kiss her and tell her I love her but everything I do feels shallow and pointless even when I'm with her. What the fuck is wrong with me? edit: it's fucking 2 am and I'm not sleeping, even though I have work tomorrow at 7. I don't know why, I'm just not getting into bed. I know I should, I know I need sleep, but for some reason I'm just not getting in bed. I'm tired, I'm just fucking not. I don't get any of this.",0
It's night and as usual that's when all these horrible thoughts come to my head. I know I'm not a terrible person but I haven't exactly had the best year so I feel kind of overwhelmed right now. I really need to talk to someone ASAP I don't feel good.,0
"I'm finally going in for a check up with an actual psychiatrist soon for my depression. I'm researching into the different kinds of antidepressants and found that Wellbutrin seemed best fit for my case except for the issue of it causing a person to become more anxious? Has wellbutrin worsened your anxiety/make you more anxious? I have depressive episodes where I can't get out of bed, feel numb towards emotions, want to be left alone/don't want to talk to people, unproductive. But I also feel like I have high anxiety? But the anxiety usually comes as a result as the unproductiveness (i.e. late/rushed assignments).",1
"Btw I'm beyond nervous, I am terrified right now. Lets see what happens today. Hope you all have a good day today!",0
you say you want me to be real with you and that I can talk to you about anything but at the same time you keep saying quit being so negative and bringing the mood down,0
"all of the years ive been chubby and we had other problems since my mom was depressed (plus other mental ilnesses) now i was diagnosed with mental ilness and he is disappointed because he is afraid i will turn like my mother. Yesterday at night i went to the bathroom which is next to my parents bedroom and he said to my mom about her but then he also included me '' i am disgusted by fat, its disgusted, filthy and dirty i don't even know how to express it to my daughter''. It just broke me, broke me to pieces. I doubt he even loves me, i have seen him looking at me with disappointment when i eat something it's just makes me hate my self more and make me want to kill myself.",1
"Hey guys, I've been really distant from people lately, friends and family and everyone really, I've just preferred to be by myself, apart from when I'm with my girlfriend but it's been like this for a few months now. I've gotten inconsistent with training and it's something that I'd usually never skip, I'm very passionate about and I have plenty of motivation for. I procrastinate with college all the time even though I know it'll make life harder for me in the long run and I've left my diet slip. I really want to be the social, healthy, motivated and driven person that I know I can and I used to be, but it almost feels like that person is trapped and being held back inside of me unable to control the me on the outside. I feel lazy and sad and like I'm not a nice person to be around. Maybe these all seem like obvious symptoms of depression, and maybe they seem like they're obviously not symptoms of depression and they're something else, but I just don't know, I'd be really grateful if someone could let me know if they think I should see a doctor about depression or if they think I need to do something else. I don't want to ask people to diagnose me or anything like that, and I really don't want to come across like I think it's that easy to diagnose or anything, I just don't really want to talk to friends and people irl about it, I think I could be more honest here and I think people here could be more understanding and knowledgeable about everything tbh. Thanks a lot guys, it feels nice to be able to get it all out in the open!",1
"I feel like life isn't going anywhere and I don't have goals or ambitions that are attainable right now. Once I get back to work yea I got goals of getting my fiance a place and us having kids but right now it seems so far off and impossible to reach, im also feeling trapped by my thoughts. More so a voice in my head that sounds very familiar to me father's that just tears me down from the inside out when I get down, and then I feel like that me being down all the time is gonna fuck up things with my fiance, she loves me and helps me a ton but I feel like I'm a burden on her and I don't like any of this. I know this is just a rough patch and that things will get better but right now it's hard for me to see that and I just needed to unload thus jumbled mess of thoughts off my chest. I have a better life than a lot of people and I'm gonna be fine it's just these down moments seem endless and it makes me feel stuck.",0
"Hi, does anyone else cope pretty well during the day (by keeping busy, staying relatively productive thus numbing out your emotions) and then completely fall apart at night? I've been doing pretty okay during the day, but at night I am almost always suicidal. Yesterday, I cried from 7PM to 1AM and it was completely exhausting. It took everything out of me and I just wanted to end it all. But then, by the morning, I am almost completely fine? Like i don't even feel depressed or suicidal at all... and then I invalidate my depression and I question if I do really have it or not? But then the cycle continues... suicidal at night, okay during the day, questioning/invalidating my depression and then suicidal at night again. Other times I just feel completely numb and dissociated and as if I'm floating and living in limbo and just existing but not actually living. Does anyone experience this? How do you deal with it?",0
"I feel and felt like this for the majority of my life. I want to do a lot of things but realizing I suck so much at them, I just stop it. It‚Äòs so maddening to feel like a loser. It‚Äòs like people would be better off without me because since I have nothing to contribute. Is it normal to feel like you‚Äòre too stupid to aquire skills?",1
"I can't really explain what's up with my mind, but today I sent everyone my final goodbye to them, the way they behaved makes me want to die more, now I am determined to do so",0
"Sometimes without even meaning to, I will just sit here and think about the accumulative shit that went on in my childhood that has resulted in this depressed mess. Like, it isn't one thing, but rather a whole string of things that eventually connect when you think back on it. Sometimes it keeps me up at night (posting this at 5:05 am right now)",0
"So, I have been thinking of harming myself lately even though it's been a while since I've done it. I've been able to keep myself from harming myself or doing drugs for a while now but something just snapped in recent months that's making me just irritable, impatient, and wanting to spiral out of control again. I just feel like a shell and any kind of physical pain is like breath of fresh air. Anyone else go through something like this? If you got through it, how?",0
"Im autistic, with disabilities and unable to go out on my own. I soend most my time alone. I have no family but care workers come a few hours a day to care for me. Sometimes its ok, other times like now I end up crying. The last visitor I have had, other than care staff was 24th December.... I get communication online some... But not to much... And its just not the same as soending time in person. That person has not messaged since. Im missing human contact. Im unsure who really is a friend and who is not. I am so lonely. I feel so unwanted... Any advice welcome",1
"I recently started dating my Deaf friend and she opened right up to me about how she had depression and contemplated suicide a few years ago. She says she felt like a burden to the people around her. Having to learn a new language just to talk to her, not listening to her because they don‚Äôt understand her voice, and not wanting to communicate with her at all. We watched a movie the other day at my house and she fell asleep on my chest. I rolled up her sleeve because it was getting caught on my watch, and I saw a massive amount of old scars on her left arm. I pulled her sleeve right down and just thought for a second. I‚Äôve never seen her without a long sleeve shirt or a coat on. Even though I‚Äôve been one of her closest friends for years. She obviously cuts herself, or used to cut herself as the case may be. She has apparently been feeling heaps better recently so thats great, she says she learnt to smile, and that she learnt there are people that care for her. And I believe her. But what if this happens again? What if she has another rough trot? What am I to do, I feel like I won‚Äôt be enough to stop her. Even if she is past this, I‚Äôm worried. Is it normal to be worried?",0
"Please can someone help me - I am feeling particularly depressed at the moment and very erratic - my boyfriend is really worn i Out by me and I feel like he is very close to giving up - he gets upset that he has to walk on eggshells constantly because I think he will leave me , he feels emotionally blackmailed and overwhelmed - do any of you guys have any tips or tricks (CBT etc) when it comes to adapting your thought processes and behaviours to be more rational, less ‚Äúattention seeking‚Äù and less imposing on your partner - I want to save my relationship as it‚Äôs going so well and is the best I‚Äôve ever had - ps: already on 20mg of citalopram (posted about this yesterday)",0
"Changed sm this past year. Not really the same person anymore, I used to be this emotional person that let people walk over them but now I am kinda the opposite and I hate it in a way because I‚Äôd pretty much rather be an emotional sensitive wreck than an emotionless person that keeps to themselves. Deep down I crave the feeling of love though, but I‚Äôm just scared of it all because I haven‚Äôt felt it in so long. I‚Äôm scared I am never gonna be able to let anyone in ever again and I‚Äôm gonna be lonely my whole life. I feel so far away from everything and I cannot seem to connect with anyone anymore, that‚Äôs life I guess; waiting for the day this all goes away and everything feels bright again. It‚Äôll come.",1
"They said they would help me when I felt like this but all I got was ‚Äústop feeling sorry for yourself‚Äù and ‚Äújust let yourself be happy‚Äù. Idk why I even open up to people, it never helps in the end. I don‚Äôt deserve their help anyway, they shouldn‚Äôt have to worry about someone like me. I just want to leave. I‚Äôm done living, I hate it. I would rather stop existing then live in the nightmare of my own head.",1
"so.. hi... im a 17 y/o guy living in southern mississippi. i have a girlfriend whos younger than me. and at first everything felt great, she made me happy. first of all some background, ive struggled with depression for almost my whole life considering i was bullied hard in elementary and middle school. the sadness strengthened its grip on my throat around freshman year of highschool because of a break up i went through, and yeah i know its stupid. but anyways after that, i lost my religion after a while and growing up in south mississippi if youre not christian youre fucked. i also eventually stopped being straight. even worse. after all this i got around 11th grade and school was fucking my life up and just making me so stressed i started having heart palpitations. okay now back to what i was gonna say before. everythings great between me and her. its just she used to make the bad thoughts go away, but now theyre back and they brought a fucking army. i just dont know what to do anymore. ive pretty much given up on ever feeling happiness again. honestly, it feels like all color is just fading away.",0
"I‚Äôll keep this short.My parents have been working abroad since I was 6, even before that they used to work around the country so I was ‚Äòraised‚Äô by my grandparents(2 drunks who couldn‚Äôt give 2 shits about me).But my parents ? They have been home for about 2 months now, without a job, always nagging and yelling at me.I came to the realization that they know nothing about me, we‚Äô re like complete strangers.They‚Äôve missed so many important moments in my life and now it‚Äôs too late.I‚Äôm used to being alone, doing everything on my own, solving the problems I have by myself.My mom wants to ‚Äòget‚Äô me better now, but she treats me like I am 10.She hasn‚Äôt seen me grow and mature, barely knows anything about me.I even did well in school despite my depression, complete lack of motivation and ADD.I didn‚Äôt ask to be born into this shit, I wish I never was.",0
"This is my first thread on reddit, but I felt I needed somewhere to reddit. Anywho, my birthday is tomorrow and my family usually doesn't make a big deal about it, but since i'm turning 21 my ""dad"" seems adamant about taking me to some bar to get me drunk which I'm not too thrilled about, but he'll probably throw a fit if I say no. This just seems to be making my depression and anxiety worse and I feel like I just want to go into a coma until my birthday is over with.",0
I don't want to get back to school yet.... I'm got so fucking worst... I can't even sleep and in just a few hours I'll have to pretend that I'm ok and interact with people.....,0
"I've had a rough two weeks and can't study for shit right now. I don't feel like I can talk to anyone and thoughts of suicide are having a hayday. Any belief I used to have in myself being other than a failure has crashed to pieces for the millionth time... But I still have to sit up and shut up, and not show a thing. My grandparents - ALL of them - are still sick and have been so for several weeks, my grandma had even been rushed to ER but at least she's in recovery now. My family - Mom, Dad and little sister - have had no choice but to rush between them with the little time off work they've had. Except that I'm studying so my family insisted I won't take days off. My family is busy all week trying to keep the situation under control, and I can't help them. On the other hand I also can't study because I'm so depressed my brain won't work, or rather it works overtime on focusing on how I feel and not on studying. So not only am I a worthless sack of shit on my own, I'm also letting down my family and can't do anything about my depression since they are already so burdened.",1
"I've been suffering from clinical depression for 6 months now and it took so much from me. I've had irregularities in my behavior ever since and obviously it took the attention of my friends. But instead of generally lifting me up, it actually made me feel worse. I've been having frequent breakdowns at school and I feel like most of my friends are getting sick and tired of me. It doesn't help that one of my friends confirmed this by telling me the last time I had a breakdown, one of my friends got upset because I still act ""this way"" even though they're trying they keep ""cheering me up"". One even just gave me advice to just ""help myself"". It feels like they think I'm using the ""I'm depressed"" as an excuse for every breakdown I have. I mean, I can't blame them, even I'm getting tired of myself.... but it's not really my fault I'm suffering what I'm feeling, is it? I wish I could change myself in an instant...",0
"About a year ago I met a girl, while I was doing fine. Guess she noticed that I'm feeling down and saw my arm (I was and am cutting) she wanted to hear everything, I was scared to lose her if I wouldn't be honest so I told her everything. Yet I can't help but notice that she seems sad whenever seeing me, prob cuz I told her everything. I said her multiple times that if I'm a burden she should just forget and not talk to me like everyone else... though she denies it, I believe I am. Think she's just lying to me to not make it 'worse'. In the end, I decided to do her a favour and stopped talking to her.",0
I have about a week until I'll be kicked out to find a job because my brother can't afford to have me and I've applied for liturally about 40 jobs and my cv is as solid as someone without experience can be. Then after that I'll essentially be homeless.,0
"I often think about ways I could maybe kill myself. Like stabbing a kitchen knife into my heart or stepping in front of a bus. I don‚Äôt know if that would work or if I‚Äôd ever actually do it but the thoughts are there. Sometimes I feel like I want to die. Like I don‚Äôt care if I died or not at that moment. But sometimes I don‚Äôt want to at all. Does that make sense/is that normal? I was raped a few years ago but have never spoken to someone professional about it. My husband knows but he doesn‚Äôt speak about it and tells me I should talk to someone if I want to. I don‚Äôt know if he just isn‚Äôt the kind of talking person or if he doesn‚Äôt actually care - it was a mutual friend of ours and he knows that. When I watch tv programmes or see news articles of people getting raped I get really angry, I think this might be when I start thinking about ways I could die. If I was dead I‚Äôd never have to be reminded or think about rape again. Some days my thoughts overwhelm me and I don‚Äôt want to get out of bed. I want to get up and have a nice day but something just seems to stop me. I don‚Äôt know what and I just feel really shit and down. Am I just being stupid? Or is this something that is normal? Should I get professional help?",0
"This whole time I have been sleeping and acting like an ungrateful brat. Things are bad, but I had the whole December off and it was enough time to recoup my thoughts and soul. I think at least if I can't change my whole life, maybe I can start believing in the future and being nice in people and seeing the good in them and just have faith in humanity. I don't think I'll ever find peace, even if I achieve all my dreams, it's the human condition--but I want to at least give something back to the world and live on that way, let someone carry forward my flame of hope and passion. Before I die I'd want to write a book or make a film or something. Even if touches just ONE person, it'll be enough.",1

You only have a limited shared interests with one friend. There are so many times I get excited about something or want to discuss some things, but no one is there! People just keep baling on me because they think I'm being over-dramatic, exaggerating my situation and pain... I have health problems that causes mood issues with me and sometimes I can say things or act weird. I've explained this and at first people claim to understand and will stick with me but in the end they just ignore me or some stupid argument causes a rift! I'm sick of it!

Of course I love the thought of living with my boyfriend and I love our apartment, but I just feel like there's a tight grip around me. On New Years Eve, I told my boyfriend that I feel bad, that I'm wishing to have a car accident, that I just want everything to stop. He got angry, told me that I'm selfish and that I should stop with these thoughts. I would never ever kill myself, I could never do it. So no worries. I started hurting myself again, biting my arms, biting my lips. Nobody knows how I feel. Nobody. I feel alone even if I have a wonderful boyfriend and good friends.

"First off I don't really have a reason to be depressed as such. I've got friends, a good job, a wife, and two wonderful dogs. However I still can't help but feel low as hell quite often. Somedays nothing seems worth it and I feel like I'm trapped in this life because leaving being my career for something I enjoy is pointless. I have several passions such as writting, video games, and cars. Butbi am not good at any of these things so it just ultimately seems ridiculous. I feel bad for my wife because I am extremely bad at expressing any emotion and mostly just hang out somewhere in the middle instead of being excited or supportive. I've felt like I'm a bit off for a long time but I have avoided seeking any help out of shame or fear. My job won't allow for me to seek mental help without transferring me and I've always been rather prideful. I don't even feel comfortable talking to my wife about it and any childhood friends are thousands of miles away at this point. Honestly idk what the hell I'm here for or if this ramble even makes sense. I'm just tired of feeling down for days at a time.",0

I don't want to tell my parents, my friends, because I'm scared they'll think I'm doing this for attention, or because I'm weak. I can't bring myself to tell them I feel useless, that my life has no direction and I'm constantly worried, anxious and tired. I always think about my life as a set of goals, that once done i'll feel a bit happier, or that life will just get better; - Afford to buy a new car. Done, I still feel bad. - Grow your biceps 2"". Done. I still feel bad. - Increase your benchpress. Done. I still feel bad. .. and so on. I'm not asking for help, I just needed to say it.",1
"This will sound trivial perhaps but I don't know where else to post it. I got enough friends posting on my wall but there's always that one person you deeply care about that doesn't wish you a happy birthday. Then your mind sorta spirals that they don't care about you, that you love them but they either hate you or couldn't care less about you. It's just the person is special and I'm not, and if I lose her as a friend then I'll never find someone like that again. I don't blame her, I bring all my problems to her and she's deeply caring but I think that's just the way she is. And if I got that happy birthday from her I would probably be relieved for a few minutes but that's it. It's just invalidating that the person I share the most to doesn't even really care about me, but my mind just might be jumping to conclusions. Anyways thanks for listening",1

I'm having urges to sneak in one day (school is out where I live currently) and start smashing windows and breaking computers and just destroying anything I can find in that shithole.

"I have seen the same therapist for four years twice a week. We generally meet on the same day, same time, but that's not fixed in stone. There have been occasions where both of us cancel sessions due to sickness, emergency or family issue. That's not a problem. My therapist was scheduling my appointments for this month and the first week of the month was booked when my time to schedule came. She put me on a wait list. I didn't expect a call mostly due to logistics. How did I feel? I was triggered. I felt ignored and taken for granted, but I didn't say anything because that means I have confront one of my demons. My therapist has mentioned several times in the past months that she has a long waiting list of potential clients. Again, I didn't say anything to avoid a possible confrontation. Folks, I'm going to be in therapy a long time, a long, long time. Why? That's what helps me from running off the road. Is it reasonable to ask my therapist that I would appreciate a call to schedule appointments if her schedule is filling up? Should ask her is she trying to tell me something about her waiting list? My therapist is very good at her job. However, I've learned the way not to get too comfortable with any mental health professional.",0

I just wish I had a gun, a rope, something, to end this misery. That's what I am right now, miserable. Not just now, for the past week, I have been miserable. But, the fact of the matter is, I don't want to get better anymore. The only way people know how treat me is to hospitalize me or IOP me or PHP me etc... These solutions clearly don't solve the problem. Maybe this is my farewell note to the world, I don't know. I just need an exit strategy that limits the fallout. I don't want to shoot myself because that's too nuclear. I wish there was a full proof way of OD'ing. That way my family (the last vestige of people who care) would be able to see me at peace. I am Humpty Dumpty. Some things can't be repaired. Maybe that's OK and maybe that's why we have suicide.",0
"So, I'm medicated but not in therapy, and this is more a collection of thoughts than a coherent chain, but it's something I've been thinking about often of late. Anyway, here we go. &amp;nbsp; I want to be neurotypical. It sucks there's no cure for depression, you know? And that NT people have no fucking frame of reference talking about depression, like I have no frame of reference talking to someone with bipolar, which brings me to my next point. &amp;nbsp; Depression isn't ""really sad,"" you can't even fucking be sad when you're depressed. You can't enjoy the things you used to enjoy. For me, depression has always been this suffocating apathy, and ""feeling"" isn't an option. I'm not crying because I'm sad, I'm crying because I'm feeling nothing, and it feels pointless. &amp;nbsp; I want to be a whole person. I'm not motivated. There's nothing I really want from life. &amp;nbsp; ""I took the medicine, but the pills don't work, the pills they don't do anything, but rearrange all the littlest things."" This is a lyric by the band Streetlight Manifesto. Like I mentioned, I'm on medication, but the suicidal ideation never stops.",0
"Kinda lengthy post, but I'm just really lost right now so my apologies in advance... So today, my best and only friend, he finally gave up on me. I've tried my very best to hide my depression from him, even going as far as constantly putting a mask on and suppressing my true emotions in an attempt to appease him and not become burdensome. But as many of you well know, that tends to become rather exhausting real quick... and sometimes our depressive nature shows. And today mine showed. He wanted to hangout and watch something, and I wasn't feeling up to it at all, so I politely let him know. He then went on to say in response ""You're always in such a gloomy mood... stop trying to make people feel bad for you cause it's not gonna happen."" He then told me that I need to grow up and that he doesn't want to talk to me for a while until I grow up... I'm not sure what to do now, like how I should go about this. I guess I just need some advice and/or guidance fellas. Anything will be immensely appreciated. Thank you for at least taking the time to read.",0
"It's like cancer. ""You've got 4 months to live."" But sometimes for some reason you outlive their prognosis. ""You've lived for 3 months more!"" It's like suicide. You choose a week. Or you think this week will be the last one. And surprisingly, when THE day comes...it goes just as it comes and you are still breathing. When do you know it's time? Well, I've been spinning in circles for a while now. Round and round and round. Joy, sadness. Over and over and over again. In my dream world, I would be happy, not angry, not sad. I would finally be able to evolve into the woman I envision myself as instead of constantly grabbing her by the cuff of her sleeve. And I would finally publish my book, and be confident in the story. Maybe even sing some songs and feel confident about it. Have a guy who will love me and cherish me. Not control me, not contact me only when he wants something, not judging me and calling me chubby. Be able to be worthy enough for the attention of this one guy in my school. I always see him. Always. But he just doesn't see me. I guess that's how it's supposed to be. With a guy who looks like an Abercrombie Fitch model and a girl who looks like she sells tomatoes for a living. A guy who has nearly a thousand followers on Instagram and a girl who just has 400. Funny isn't it? Or friends who don't constantly make death jokes with me. ""I should get your head tattooed with a noose around your neck"". Thanks, best friend.",0
A teacher told me that i am an empty minded person when i was in english prepration class. I just want to ask that empty minded is a negative adjective? I cant find any info on the internet.

People just go around and fill out greeting cards with such ease and comfort. Me? I just stare at them and think Do I really care? Does the person really care receiving them? I'm jealous of people who are able to just buy greeting cards and write some crap.

I feel so pathetic and shitty that something so simple gives me such problems and anxiety. I hate myself for this stupid crap.,0

Ive also realized that I‚Äôve been limiting myself to doing things that might trigger his depression or that it will worsen it. For example, he doesn‚Äôt really like going out but I enjoy the occasional dance night with my friends or something and I feel like he dreads me going out and if I do he gets really sad. So I‚Äôve tried to stay in, which is still fun for me,but if I ever want to go out i just don‚Äôt want to make him worse.

While I'm still at school, I do a side job to pay for my study. But that employer doesn't have work for me anymore. I have to quit. I'm probably gonna fail school and a couple of months ago I let go all my relatives. Today I have like 2 or 3 friends, but none of them are the type of friends that can borrow me anything. I literally don't know what to do anymore. Wish a burglar would just walk in and shoot me in the head. Or a car would just run me over. I don't have the power on my side. I don't feel any love from this world. I have a belt lying beside me, but I can't bring myself to wrap it around my neck. I still have dreams, but I don't know how I can survive from here on.

Where I could be me and enjoy my usual stuff like music and anime, where I don't have to perform to get a decent salary, where I can just live. What should I do",0
"A few months ago (possibly more, my perception of time isn't great right now) my best friend started having seizures, and a tumour was discovered in his brain. Since then he's been through various rounds of radio and chemotherapy, and today had the results back from a recent scan. The tumour has reduced massively in size, and the parts they were really concerned with appear to be gone. This is brilliant news! And while I feel a sense of relief, and am no longer fixated on ""what if it's terminal?"", I just can't seem to feel any positivity. I don't want this to have an impact on our relationship, but I feel like I'm withdrawing and slipping away from him. We used to live together, but he's back living with his parents (since before the tumour) due to other issues. I'm trying to be there for him, but between work and constantly feeling like shit, I feel like I'm letting him down. I don't know whether I'm asking for advice or just ranting. I just feel so lost.",0
"I‚Äòm just so obsessed with how I should look and appear to others. My mind always strives for perfection and I get very upset and worried when I don‚Äòt achieve that. There are the things that I can work on, I usually do them as good as I can but then there are just things that I can‚Äòt change, and it‚Äòs just fucking distressing and dreadful to my mind. I have a deep overbite, protruding ears and fat eyebrows, that has a weird horizontal blank mark on the right brow. Although the whole image of myself doesn‚Äôt look too bad, despite my bad facial features, I just can‚Äòt get over it. I have such things in my mind 24/7 and am extremely self-conscious about it. I can‚Äôt eat or do anything with myself without having my mind in peace and I often just freak out on the inside when I compare myself to others. My negative thoughts have occasionally lead me to wanting to be dead and I know that they are often irrational. There‚Äòs nothing I can think about to stop those thoughts, except to work on them and fix it with money, but the problem is that I dont have the money. Sorry if this post has gotten way too long, I just felt like I had to let those thoughts free into a post. I don‚Äòt know..

"Let me start off by saying that I wasn't always this way. I used to be an advanced student in elementary school and had a passion for reading and learning; I could absorb knowledge and I had a social life. Then, things took a drastic change in 5th grade for no obvious reason. I suddenly felt tired all the time; as if I didn't sleep enough. All I could think was ""why am I so tired? I'll sleep more tonight"" every day. For the first time in my life, I failed a test. I broke down in tears in the middle of class and was surrounded in anxiety and depression. I also somehow ""obtained"" adhd/extreme forgetfulness and started losing my ability to properly comprehend people speaking to me and use my mind's eye to visualize anything... I was uninhibited in many social situations (my best friend's mom thought I was using drugs before I even knew what a marijuana was) and extremely anxious in others. Stimulants didn't help much besides giving me energy and although anti-depressants help with my mood, all the other symptoms remain. I have a feeling that this is a brain tumor or brain damage because of how it affects me so broadly. I've never had suicidal thoughts and honestly, I don't think too much at all. Nothing crisp, anyways. I'm 19 now and not sure where to proceed from here. My mom believes it's because I became an atheist and my dad thinks it's because I just don't care. Professionals (doctors, therapists, psychiatrists) don't seem to know what's going on with me. My thyroid and bloodwork is fine and I got a sleep study done. Should I see a neurologist or another specialist?",0

"I tried to post this on a proof reading sub but it's pretty inactive. After a long struggle I recently decided to seek medical help and was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. Although i finally have a plan towards recovery and medication as my tool, i chose to seek help after this past semester had ended. Due to my mental illness I couldn't do my best academically to get out of my academic probation (a result of failing to seek help earlier than later) and such I'm facing dismissal from my college. All i needed is one more semester to graduate. But there is hope :), I chose to appeal the dismissal and had to write a 3 paragraph max explaining the circumstances that affected my academic performance and a plan towards success. Here is a link to guidelines and my finished petition: https://drive.google.com/open?id=11g3mmfG5uUOe5wCMQZlUZKpZgzp-HZRf All i ask is for someone to please proof read the short petition for me.

This guilt is becoming so overbearing and I can't bring myself not to feel it.

When I sleep for 8 hours I just feel tired, if I don't have something obligatory to do I cant get out of bed, I tried a lot of things multiple alarm clocks, have my mom call me nothing, etc. I just want to sleep for 8 hours like a normal person and feel refreshed.

INFP, for any myer-briggs fans out there. I'm probably the most emotional person you'll ever see. My heart totally rules my head. But I do have morals which keeps me sane of course. I get attached pretty easily, and I'm pretty clingy. Maybe a bit too much for normal people to handle...

I feel like a failure every step of the way because I'll never live up to anyone expectations, not even my own. I'm so lost. I didn't want any of this and I still don't but I can't end it because of earthly ties I didn't want in the first place. At this point I just feel like I'm waiting for my mind to finally snap and completely stop caring, and just kill my self. I'm sorry for the wall of text, I don't post on Reddit often at all but I'm just so tired and I need to write something down somewhere, thanks for listening..",1
"I'm really struggling at college, I've gotten to the point where some days i just stay in bed all day and miss class. Football practice is the only reason I leave my dorm and even that sucks. I'm insanely lonely I try to make friends by joining clubs and volunteering but that does not really seem to help. My luck is no better with girls because I come off kinda clingy. I've gotten to the point where I can't even see a future for myself like if I drop out or transfer there isn't really a future anywhere else. I am so lost.",1
"Everything is so numb and i feel drained. I need a sense of community, but I have trouble connecting to people out of personal shame. I push people away when I need them to stay around, in backwards hope that they will pull me closer. I feel like a screaming child that no one wants to comfort because the screaming has gotten on everyone's nerves.",0
"My life is so monotonous... I wake up, go to school, come home and play video games, sleep and repeat. The only enjoyment I've had my winter break or the past few years is when I get high with hydrocodone or other pills. Haven't left my house to do anything in years. (Besides school which is hell as well.) No one ever texts me or care s so I dont see the point in living anymore! I'm tired of being alone, unhappy and worthless. The best part is I'm currently out of pills which is the only thing that is making me feel somewhat good.

"I‚Äôve been depressed on and off for years. it‚Äôs to the point that I‚Äôve accepted it and it‚Äôs stuck in my head that money is the only thing that matters to me because I don‚Äôt feel love like I used to. mainly because I don‚Äôt experience it. my first relationship I was broken up with 29 days later because she said she didn‚Äôt feel like I loved her. it‚Äôs been 3 Years now and every since then I don‚Äôt want to give another person love. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm emotionally broken. I just don‚Äôt see a point in loving another person like I did before. why waist my time with that when I could make money instead? I like seeing the bills stack up. I legit even love the smell of it. I know it‚Äôs more to life then money and etc, but I don‚Äôt want that stuff. I was thinking yesterday about what I‚Äôd buy with my money and the answer is nothing. I just want it. and I beat myself up about it because I know better. I really do know money can‚Äôt buy happiness, but nothing makes me happy now except the thought that I have money. I don‚Äôt want to build connections with people. I just want money. can anybody relate?",0
"My boyfriend dumped me on Tuesday night. Yesterday afternoon I was really upset so I asked my ex boyfriend's best friend if we could hang out. We got coffee, talked and laughed about stuff and we made plans to hang out today. Yesterday night I was really upset so I asked him to come over. We got food and went back to my apartment. We talked for a while and I got really sad and started crying. He hugged me and told me that I'll be okay. I just really wanted physical attention and love at that point so I kissed him and straddled him and we made out for a while. Today he came over and we just hung out and played cards and stuff. He said we should go for a drive which we did and then he wanted to show me his apartment. We went inside and he showed me around. We went into his room and he took his jacket off and we started kissing a lot. I laid in his bed and he got on top of me and we made out some more. He kept telling me how beautiful and gorgeous I am and eventually we had sex. Do you think I'm a whore?",1
I‚Äôve been feeling so alone lately.. trapped in my own room and even worse trapped in my head. I have nobody.. nobody to talk to about my problems. Nobody to listen to me. Nobody to help. Sometimes I don‚Äôt think any of it is worth it anymore. I hide all the pain and pretend like everything is okay but it‚Äôs not. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.,0
"I don't know why I thought anyone might ever care when the cold reality is that no one ever does and the harsh truth just slapped me hard in the face. My best friend and I were out for a walk, talking about everyday stuff and how we're both doing pretty bad in university. ""I'm probably gonna drop out,"" I said. ""and end up killing myself."" ""Me too, economically."" ""No, I mean kill myself as in die and get buried six feet underground."" ""Uh why are you suddenly talking like that?"" ""Been thinking about it since I was fifteen."" ""That's really weird. You're super weird."" Silence. Continues to talk about other meaningless shit in his life, as if I didn't just fucking admit to wanting to commit suicide. No ""are you okay"", no ""if you need anyone to talk to I'm here"", *no ""please don't do it""*, no nothing. Yeah, I don't even know why I bother anymore. People don't care about me when I'm alive, they sure as hell won't care when I'm dead either.",0
"I've been very good at hiding my feelings and helping others when they're having their shitty days and always be positive about the future .

"I just don't think I'm cut out for this world. I have absolutely zero resilience in any way and I'm so lost. I feel as if I have no more chances left. I have to find a job but I have no car. I don't have any money or a way to make money because I have no skills. I just don't know where to start, where to look, or who to trust anymore. I just can't see how I will ever be successful. Things aren't going to just change either. Everyone likes to say things get better and life changes unexpectedly but I just don't see how any of that could possibly be true. I might as well just end it. I certainly talk enough about it. Doesn't make death any less scary, but death being scary isn't exactly reason enough to stay alive either. I have no confidence for the future or any reason to be. All I can really forsee is greater hardships down the road. Rationally, the only things that could really change in my life are bad things, and that really shows how much farther I have to fall. Sometimes I wonder how my brothers are doing. They haven't had to face the real world yet but they definetely won't be able to without help. I wish I could help but I can't even help myself. Maybe someone will offer them some opportunities they can make into careers, idk. I hope. I hope they learn about the predatory nature of the world and how to survive it. It's a harsh world. A cold world. I can't face the responsibility to just deal with it like everyone else. I'm trash.",1

If anyone else has been prescribed Lexapro has it helped you or made your depression worse?,0
Most of my adult life I can't seem to hold down a full time job. I can't seem to focus at all and i find it difficult staying in work. Don't get me wrong I like working and I like getting a pay-check but with me being prone to depression I find it increasingly difficult to maintain steady employment. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with the stress of work when you're already mentally stressed dealing with depression?,0
"In high school I was depressed. I cried myself to sleep every night and wished I would die over my meaningless woes. I am now 25 and 2017 was the happiest year of my life, but the past week I have been completely unmotivated. I do not want to die, but I have lost all desire to live. I search for joy and find fleeting moments. The love that is right in front of me feels like a far away flame. I watch the days pass me by and sleep seems to be the only thing I enjoy.",0
"Ever since my divorce it's been like trying to dig out of a pit. Everytime I climb I get pushed back down again. I haven't had a car since my divorce. I haven't had a good steady job in months. My step dad that claims he loves and cares about me hasn't taken any time out for me at all since before my divorce. I lived in that house, alone, for six months. Not a single person came to visit me. Not one. Right now I don't really see anyone. No one ever takes the time to really spend any with me. I had a girlfriend but her and I just broke up. I was told that I wasn't sexually attractive to her and that because I had to no car and no job she wasn't as attractive to me. *sigh* I just don't want to live. I've lost so much in my life and feel like I've gained nothing. I really really wish I had a car and some help, but no one cares.",0
"When daydreaming my mind brings up negative memories. In any situation, in any location my mind will simply wander and bring up pessimistic memories instantly. I'll often be left pondering ""why did I do that?"" - ""why did I say that?"". These will often be memories or sort of quick snapshots of uneasy moments in my life that will flash through my psyche as soon as I have a spare moment. It's happened on the train, when at work and socialising with friends. The odd thing is that the memories vary in date - it could be something I said last week, to something I did at a party when I was like five years old. The underlying factor is that all of these memories will have negative associations and will leave me questioning my actions, thoughts and responses at the time. It seems as though I have no control over what memories or images appear - I have been overheard saying ""How can I even remember that!"" when peculiar or seemingly distant images re-appear. Does anyone else have any similar experiences with this? And apologies if this is not the correct Reddit for this post.",0

I feel like a loser because I do not have a group of friends. I have friends but I do not have a group of them to be with while I'm at college. I feel like a loser because I'm always alone. Unfortunately I'm to blame because I am extremely introverted and self conscious. I'm self conscious to the point where I won't be friends with people because acquaintances mocked them frequently. I'm very lonely. I began to use weed as a coping mechanism for my depression and we all know how that has turned out. I'm very low risk because I believe that I have more to live for. I'm just tired of feeling alone.,1
"It hurts so much. The distance between myself and the people I know keeps growing, and it's all my fault. I've turned myself into a guy that noone wants to deal with, and its breaking my heart.

I'm not ugly, people usually say I'm good looking and charismatic. The reason I'm talking about this stuff is I see people who say they are ugly, their family do not like time etc. I'm not judging or underestimating them by any means, don't get me wrong. I'm just saying that I have a lot of things good in my life and I still do not want to live. I'm just so tired and sick of this life. The people. Everything.

"I‚Äôve noticed lately that my energy level is very very low. It usually was but now its insanely low. And..I know why. I‚Äôve always been struggling with depression, but the one thing that could keep me the slightest bit happy was myself. I loved myself, who I was, the way I looked. But ever since 7th grade I felt..different. (I‚Äôm in 8th now) now I know it‚Äôs only been a year and a half but still...it‚Äôs been too long. I‚Äôve never felt this way. I can barely go to school because of how much I feel hated. Mostly I hate myself. I can‚Äôt walk through the halls normally, I can‚Äôt without thinking at least 5 negative thoughts about myself. Getting off the bus gives me so much anxiety I could cry. I‚Äôve stated this before in my recent posts. Coming up to my stop today I had a panic attack. I tried to control it, but I still feel like people knew something was up. Maybe they didn‚Äôt..I‚Äôm probably just paranoid like usual. Maybe it‚Äôs stress...I‚Äôve been stressing over my grades lately and trying to find out who I am. I dont want to disappoint anyone. I just want to be able to love myself again.

I was one of the only upper classmen who was really into stuff like anime and video games, so all the younger nerds sort of looked up to me? I guess? I was the drum major in my schools band, and I had all this other stuff going on. My senior year of highschool was the year I grabbed life by the balls and made it my bitch. But now look at me, I can't even muster the energy to get out of bed. I can't hold a job, I can't drive, my girlfriend left me, etc. I'm not half the person I was just a year ago. I feel like an old man past his prime, just sort of struggling and failing to keep up with the kids these days. I'm certainly out of touch at least. I don't have a clue what's going on in the nerd circles these days, let alone what's happening in the real world. I really just want to give up on life and call it quits, since I can't see myself getting out of this hole anytime soon, and when I do, I'll be so far behind everyone else that it'll just be pathetic.

I dont know if im depressed or not and i feel like i am and it's true then the pain wont be as bad with my parents knowing i have depression. If i ask to get tested, like i said they'll laugh at me.

"I know for me I came to realize by my late teenage years that I have developed dual brain consciousness. What I mean is I alternate between two states at any given moment. Around friends and family I ""turn on"" my visual hemispheres. I actively look to be creative and funny and this drains my energy. When I'm alone I turn off and operate entirely on unconscious awareness. I will stare at the wall and ""recharge"" No thoughts, no feelings, like a dead man. People who caught me in the ""off mode"" have told me I have dead eyes. All of this translates to my sex life (non existent right now) But when it was active I was never able to cum inside a woman. The reason being sex is a spontaneous act. And i operate like a robot in the off or on mode. I simply can't let go like other people. This is what causes my depression. Could be autism, adhd, or any other host of illnesses. Bottom line is after 25 years I realize you can't change it hard as you try. The neural pathways planted their roots long ago. This causes me pain because all I ever want is to socialize and keep appearances like normal people",0

I live at home, so my life is restricted a lot (due to paying college expenses). My parents frequently remind me of my lack of friends and constantly question if I‚Äôm trying to sleep with every male I talk to, and particularly question my friendship with anyone younger than me. They think that because I am gay, I am a pedophile. The few friends I had my own age ditched me because they think me being gay is disgusting.

Nobody would ever talk to me, I'm isolated beyond recovery. I'm destined to remain lonely.",0
"I am making this post mostly because for the 1st time ever somebody has called the police on me reporting that I was suicidal. I often times hit a point to where I am broke every month and I talk about wishing I could just leave earth painlessly and times where I just randomly break down because I am sick of having almost no human interaction and at the age of 30 I haven't even had so much as a girlfriend. So I am constantly questioning my worth and life based on that alone. But the cops came by my house just a couple of minutes ago and asked if I felt suicidal, and I told them no, because honestly right now I feel ""fine"". Fine in the sense that I feel I can function normally and at least for the rest of the day and probably just stay in my room and read or play random computer games. So I ask, am I even considered suicidal? While I do constantly think about what would be the repercussions of killing myself(My family kind of depends on me financially atm) I have never actually made the attempt to kill myself(Honestly just too scared I think). I'm really just curious on if I am considered suicidal or if I just need to find out how to not be a piece of shit at life.",0
"I feel nothing. I feel emotionless. My friends think that my depression is me trying to be edgy. What great friends, right? I can't write anymore. I can't draw anymore. I've opened up to my family about this but all I got was a pat on the back and a ""you'll be okay"". I feel like not even opening up to anyone anymore. How do people do this? I feel like I'm wasting my life. I'm trying to make my parents proud but they act like I'm not even here. What am I doing? Everything seems pointless. It feels like there's no hope for me anymore. I've given up on myself and so has the world. And I know what you're thinking, ""stop having a pity party. if you're so tired of feeling like this then do something about it"". And I have. I've tried every thing anyone has ever told me about getting past this or at least trying to cope with it. I'm a lost cause. I just need something, anything. How do people do this? How do I get through this before I finally and totally give up on my life and end it? What's wrong with me?",0
I am constantly getting suspended from school. People are constantly insulting me on the Internet. I bully people because of my own insecurities. I get in fights with my parents every day. I self harm. I think about killing myself everyday.,1
I feel like I‚Äôm not even a functioning human at this point. The amount of effort needed to simply get out of bed or do my homework unbearable. This is the first time where I have been able to see the physical effects of my depression just looking at myself in the mirror. And I‚Äôm at a point where my anxiety that comes with it is so bad that I would rather not do my homework and get yelled at than even think about it. I‚Äôve never told anyone I‚Äôm depressed and I just kinda be the funny one at school or with my friends. I‚Äôve never gone to a doctor or psychologist or anything about my depression but I think I may be bipolar. I do (or did) go to a psychologist for ADHD and they said when I was like 10 I might be at risk for developing bipolar disorder. But that was that I‚Äôm 14 now and that‚Äôs my theory. I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôm over reacting or something I just needed to vent. Thanks for listening to my rant.,0
And honestly I've been by myself for so long I don't even know how abouts I would even begin interacting with other people beyond superficial niceties.,0
The most heartbreaking thought I have is my mom's thoughts when she knows her kid wants to die. She doesnt know how to help. I dont know how to help either tho... Some fuckin weed would be a good start tho lol,0
"Every single moment of my life lately has been absolute torture, and filled with mental anguish. There is not many things i'd rather do at the moment besides kill myself. The problem is that I can't for one major reason. It would completely destroy my dad, and might kill him in the process too. My father and I have a special bond that you don't find with many people nowadays; we aren't just family, we are best friends. My father is the only person I can really speak my mind to, and he has said that I am his only true friend. My father has been through some dark places lately, too. It feels like the universe won't let him keep anything good for too long. He's lost about 5 jobs over the past month, through no fault of his own. My mother and the love of his life said no to his marriage proposal and left him. His parents give him 0 encouragement for anything. I won't go into any more detail about him as I'm afraid he'll find this post by some luck, and the fact that I've been rambling. The point is that if I kill myself, that would just be one more layer on top of the shit sandwich he's had to slowly eat. Sorry for the rant, I just needed to tell somebody about this, as it's been eating me from the inside out. Does anybody have a similar experience they want to get off of their chest?",0
Because I do. It hurts to look at them and notice how normal they all are compared to me. And here I am. The gay one with mental issues. They don't know how lucky they are. I don't have the right to resent them because that's just how their lives worked out. I don't know what I did to deserve this life.,0
"All my teachers can't teach for shit, the principle of my school hates me for laughing, my mom won't let me quit my piano lessons (which I'm losing motivation for and gives me anxiety), I'm having such a hard time socializing at church, I just feel like an idiot, I can't do anything right, I have no motivation to do anything, I'm getting so easily frustrated at everything, I resent my parents, and overall I just feel like I'm going to waste my life. I know at the end of the day we're going to carry on with our lives, but I just want don't know what to do with myself. I can't even talk to my parents about any of this because they think I'm a happy little angel.",0
"So sometimes when I am super lonely, depressed, and bored I enjoy a lot of ""alone time"". Well, its not even that I am enjoying it, more like I distract myself by getting off a lot. This can't be a normal way to cope. I'm thinking maybe because I recently stopped drinking and I don't smoke or do drugs that this is kinda like a crutch or something??",0
"I'm from a very fucked up country where finding any kind of meds (even antibiotics) is almost impossible. I really need my meds, this depression is getting very bad everyday, it's consuming me, I can't focus on simple things anymore and I need to study and work. I'm being abused everyday at home, it's impossible to afford a personal room and my only chance to get out of here is doing very well in college but it's so hard... I really need to succeed but I can't find any motherfucking medicine. What can I do? Whatever is a good advice, the abuse and thw pressure of succeed are killing me, if quit college things will be worse for me at home. I've heard self-cutting helps to cope the emotional pain, what's your experience with it? I don't care if ot leaves scars, I'll do anything to survive this hell. It's only one year of college, once I finish this year I'll finally be able to gtfo and find proper medicine and psychological help. It's only one year more. I need to survive no matter what I do. Edit: I made it shorter and easier to read.",0
"I feel empty inside. Like I float from day to day, moment to moment. I don‚Äôt really feel anything anymore. Just this emptiness and hollowness in my chest, right on my heart. I feel cold when I look at people, and I feel nothing towards the things that used to bring me such joy. Will this last forever? Because this is not the forever I wish to have. I am numb. I have nothing left. Sometimes I feel a part of me reaching for the happiness I once new deep down. But every time it escapes me, I feel the void deepen. How long will it be until I can feel something other than complete emptiness? I can‚Äôt take much more. Thanks for listening.",0
I've always had an insecurity and inferior complex when it comes to my definition of success. That depression is coming back to me again and I need to let out what is bothering me. I'm seeing people younger than me get into better schools than me in harder subjects that I couldn't handle. I see people moving on much farther ahead and doing things that I haven't been able to do. I wish God could have just given me more blessings. At least have let me go to UCLA regardless of major. And yet I know that I'm so lazy and not a hard worker and I can't tell you if it's my ADHD or it's actually just me. I feel like I should know better but I don't. I feel like what is easy for others is hard for myself but other people can be so harsh and just say that it's all in your head...if you just worked hard and started just focusing on your goal then things would move forward. They make it sound so easy...and I feel like it's supposed to be easy to do but I just can't do it. And I can't decide if it's just me who thinks its hard or if it's just honestly hard for me.,1
"I am out with friends right now and I am realising how alone I really am. They could be having so much fun but I'm just dragging them down. They do care for me, but I can't seem to accept it. WHY AM I SO FUCKING LONELY???",0
I hit up a friend i haven't talked to for a year due to my depression and he just ignored me. Less than a month ago we ran into each other and he told me to message him. I don't expect people to wait for me with opened arms. I hate being given false hope and false sense of some happiness. Now i am filled with guilt and stuck feeling like crap. I deserve to be alone.,0

I've been thinking more about self harm recently. A lot more about it. I haven't done it yet but I've been close to doing it and I'm scared and worried but I can't stop thinking about it. I keep looking at knifes and thinking about how they would feel cutting me or toying with things on my wrists or purposefully causing myself pain. I'm just scared about what I'll do to myself if I do give in I don't even know why I'm writing this but I guess it's better than keeping it to myself,0
"Do I go back to school and try to get an actually useful degree in STEM, even though I fucking failed calculus twice the first time around? Do I pursue teaching at the high school level?

"It's been a few months since she broke up with me. She gave me hope when she left that she may be willing to try things again down the road. I've worked on myself and matured a lot since then. I really believe she would be happy with the changes. I recently reached out and she said she wasn't ready to see me yet. I still have some hope because it sounds like she could be ready to see me eventually. I'm going to give her more space. I'm willing to be patient because I love her so much. But that doesn't mean waiting is easy, especially since I don't have any certainty. I still miss her and think about her everyday. It hurts. I try to distract myself with a lot of different things, but my mind always comes back to her. I'm not really looking for advice. I just wanted to get things off my chest because things haven't been easy for me.",0
Last time I was nowhere near as depressed as I am now or maybe I was and just didn‚Äôt realise but I lost tonnes of my hair just before starting college and it destroyed my confidence and self esteem. My depression is now back with a vengeance and I‚Äôm so worried that if my alopecia comes back this time I won‚Äôt be able to handle it. It took me so long to get over it last time and I just don‚Äôt want the cycle to restart buts it‚Äôs completely out of my control. I just wish I had some family I could talk to..,1
I wish I could kill myself without hurting anybody.,0
"Things have been super hard for me lately. I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about death and suicide, more than I ever have. I‚Äôve been having detailed thoughts of suicide‚Äîhow I would do it, where I would do it, what time of day I would do it, how people would react, IF people would react... for the first time in my life I feel like I might actually do it one of these days but idk.",0

"I've been going to therapy for about 5 months now and I've noticed some improvements in my anxiety and depression. I've been going through CBT which has lots of research support, but I always find myself slacking off on changing my behaviours and when I do that. I revert back to being depressed and suicidal. I guess I'm kind of looking for an easy fix as crazy as that sounds. Those who have gone on medication like Zoloft, Ativan, Xanax, Prozac. How was your experience with them? Did they help things or make things worse? Would it be beneficial to take meds along with therapy? I'm honestly tired of feeling like shit constantly, it's eating me alive.",1
"I‚Äôm 20 and I feel like I‚Äôm not going to get anywhere in life. I‚Äôve been struggling with depression for three years now and my life has not moved forward. I‚Äôm stuck at home doing absolutely nothing. I know that I‚Äôm not a dumb person and that if I try I‚Äôll be able to do it. I know what I should be doing but can‚Äôt/don‚Äôt, I‚Äôm not a child anymore and my family won‚Äôt support me forever. It hurts to watch everyone who believed in me and all of the people and friends in my life move on ahead while I feel stuck. I want to do what other people my age are doing. I want to build a future for myself where instead of being a burden I can instead help my family. I want to reach a place where I can do what I want without being held back. I feel like a phony and a big disappointment to everyone I meet and to myself. I know that I have so much potential but I can‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt and I don‚Äôt know why. Am I just afraid to grow up ? I‚Äôm not moving forward and I feel like I‚Äôm just being ridiculous. What do I do ?",0
"Sure, they make the depression go away. But it doesn‚Äôt fix it... antidepressants just make you numb. The reason you don‚Äôt feel depressed is cuz you don‚Äôt feel anything.

"Whatsup... I'm 22. I haven't been *depressed* For my entire life... I can think of times when I have been extremely happily (mainly middle school), and very functional despite having mild depression, such as in highschool (prior state ranked athlete), but I was wondering if people with major depression (such as myself) or bipolar disorder, or even other mental illnesses are living in a constant genetic predisposition to depression, in which (when they're off medication), their mind/thoughts/senses are always in a strings length of a depressive episode. For instance, picture an Instagram filter than is dark and bleak. I have always been a dark/unlively person and I learned to find bliss and stress reduction in my seemingly cloudy lifestyle/outlook. My ""happy"" emotions are mainly nostalgia and excitement. Like i said, i have been happy at certain points in my life, but i still always have that ""filter""... And sometimes I take solace in it. But, is it safe to say that people without a genetic predisposition to depression's brains function (from birth) as a depressed person would function while on medication?",1

Is it bad I just want to fill the empty emotionless void with somebody who could actually care and give me the love and attention I need? Somebody tell me why is that so bad. I just want to not be alone and have to cry myself to sleep to not feel so alone at night.

I am the farthest thing from physically (or socially) appealing and now I'm suicidal because I can't hang out with anyone anymore without wanting to die.

The bullshit standards and weight of people enforcing them won't. I went through some emotional shit before, I have fucked up before, but I won't act like this crap defines me or my worth as a human. This life is worth more than a grade, a social circle, my struggle to run with asthma. Not going to act like it's all better, stuff is hard sometimes, but this world is about finding your own way.

I have zero friends and literally no family to turn to in times of desperate need. I have tried talking to doctors and therapists and that never worked either. Whenever I bring up my problems, they say I am ""indulging in self pity"" or they treat me like I am blaming other people for my misery. What am I supposed to do when my whole life has sucked and on top of that, my depression is getting worse? It hurts whenever people try to take the situation and blame it on me, when they don't know me. Fuck them. I don't know the point of this post.

I don't know how to find love and I doubt anyone will love me (and if you are going to tell me it's too early to kill myself, then let me tell you that for most people, it comes naturally without any hard work whatsoever.

I don't use my computer because ny phone allows me to stay in bed all the time comfortably. -my favorite hobby now is to mindlessly browse around YouTube -I don't like interaction with others. I prefer to stay on my phone on reddit -my job is shit but I'm too comfortable here -I don't study until the very last minute -I don't watch sports anymore as I'd rather be online -I can't even clean or organize my room and laundry",1
"Oh wait, it's only 5th of Jan? Oh boy, seemed so long inside my head. :/ Jokes apart, feels good, even if it's for a short amount of time, during a warm shower.",0
"I never go out anymore. I work from home and I don't really have anyone to talk to at all. It's such a weird feeling to be isolated and silent all of the time. It's been like this for years, I can't tell whether I'm tired enough but I might fall asleep soon after posting this. But then again, I might not.",0
i'm worthless and nothing to anyone. i'm going to kill myself people have ruined everything in my life for me,1
"Back in school the only time I would get attention is if someone wants me to do something, or for bullying me. In highschool and college I find everyone just ignores me. Whenever I'm in a group of people I'm always left out and whatever I try to say something to contribute to the conversation I always get ignored. Even on Reddit if I ask for help I'm always ignored. In class I see people socializing all the time but no one has ever, ever talked to me. I guess I'm just really ugly. I wish I could be attractive so I could get some attention for once. Any ""friends"" I made in college turn out to be fake fucks who only need me for helping them with assignments or some other crap. No one has ever asked me "" hey wanna hang out"" or "" reach this video game"" or something like that. I always had to make the first move. I'm tired of this shit, I wanna kms right now Edit: Well what did I say",1
"I have no motivation to live. I don't see myself getting anywhere in life. I don't have any skills, talents, accomplishments, or any real hobbies. I hate that I'm so stupid, so selfish, so socially incompetent, so incapable of performing even the most basic tasks. I hate being a complete burden on everybody. My friends don't seem to care at all about me, and my family doesn't understand my depression at all. Hell, I don't even know if I can understand it myself either. It's hard to articulate, but the best I can put it is that half the time, I feel like I'm just lying to myself and using depression as an excuse to be like this. My parents have always told me that I shouldn't even be depressed, considering how easy I have life compared to others, and as much as I hate to say it, I agree. As much as I really just want to fix everything, I feel like I just want to kill myself. But I can't do it. I don't know why, but I can't. No matter how badly I want to do it, I can't bring myself to do it. Maybe I'll just have to learn to accept living like this.",1
"I can't fucking sleep at all and I can't stop crying out of anxiety. I spent the past seven hours googling and getting worked up over a stupid medical procedure I need to get and that then morphed into me wanting to die. I'm anxious as hell and can't stop thinking about it. What's the point in living life if everything causes you pain? What did I do to deserve this? I didn't ask to be thrust into this fucking world without any say. I can't stop thinking about how life is just too painful to not be worth it at all. It's not, really. It sucks that I'd hurt so many people if I died, and it makes me angry that I have this shit holding me back from ending it all. I know they'd feel a certain way. But what about my feelings?! Why should I push through just so everyone around me can feel okay?",0
"I just really don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. My mind keeps trying to kill me while my body is trying to keep me alive. I‚Äôm starting to not feel anything at all, except being empty and depressed. Then, I get more depressed because I feel empty and I feel more empty because I‚Äôm depressed. I‚Äôve asked for help. I‚Äôve asked for so much help. But no one sees it, even the people who are payed to care. I have to keep talking myself off this ledge and I don‚Äôt even know why I do it. I‚Äôve lost everything. My family, my true friends, my baby. Everything that I care about either leaves or dies. And I‚Äôve become such a cold, empty person because of it. I feel like I‚Äôm one untied shoelace away from blowing my stack in front of everyone. Please, someone help.",0
"I was sitting in my room just trying to deal with life, and all the shit that has been thrown at me in the last few years when out of nowhere there was this flash of memory, and I remembered that this isn't the first time things have been bad, and that things have actually been far, far worse. And I remembered that all those years ago, music was life. For a brief moment, I remembered what it was like to feel. For real music, honest music, you have to be able to feel. I remembered that I would drift through the day back then so numb to the world, but when I got home, plugged up to the amp, and put on my 100 dollar studio quality headphones and magically I could feel. I wanted to remember that, so it's just what I did. Been a *long* time so I had to do some digging, and almost got stuck in the memories held by all the crap in storage, but I found it. The main volume dial needs to be replaced, and I had to rewire the speaker to the amp, but it all still works. And I played. Nothing fancy, just tuning, and some finger exercises, and other ""warmup"" stuff. I can't really remember how to play much else right now, but I did the thing, and it was great. I think I smiled for the first time in weeks.",0
"Hi, so here‚Äôs the gist of it. I‚Äôve been depressed for a while and only a few people know. I am embarrassed to tell anyone and will more than likely never tell my family. IÔ∏è think IÔ∏è have emotional issues but don‚Äôt know how to find the courage to fix them. My self-esteem is at zero and time hasn‚Äôt made things much better. What do IÔ∏è do?",1
"Just got played at work. Girl. Same old same old. I have another job. It's only part time. Just built up from homelessness after staying with a friend to a hotel. Begged and pleaded, but she's with someone else I work with after nights of flirting. Looks are not deceiving... How do I quit a job I need to not live in a tent again?",0
"Everything feels hopeless. How could I ever be happy again? If I relapsed once, who‚Äôs to say I won‚Äôt again? I don‚Äôt even know if there‚Äôs a light at the end of the tunnel",0
"For years I had been telling myself that I would never be smart enough to get a scholarship, I would never go to university, I believed I would never succeed academically. Today I got a letter from the university I applied to, they not only accepted my application but offered me a $12,000 scholarship. I should be happy, more then that, ecstatic. This is the goal I have been trying to accomplish for years, the goal I never believed I would accomplish. Now that I've finally done it I do not feel any less empty. I do not hate myself less. I still feel hatred towards myself and old doubts have been replaced with new ones. I do not get how I can go on if this is all that is going to happen. If I keep achieving things and I still have so many doubts that weigh me down or ones that leave me empty then what is the purpose of going on if you are always going to fail in some way. I used to also think that if I ever met anyone special that I would develop some confidence, but if I didn't get any after this goal then how will a romantic relationship help me? I'm scared that I will not find a meaning in my life, that I will never find worth in myself as a human being. Part of me really wants to just quit. Just stop it all so the feelings go away.",1
"I sometimes wish the world would end. Still here, I am awake, haunted by the sound of a subtle whisper. Though there's nothing left, cities sleeping that never before have heard rest, there's a feeling yearning; aching, hurting inside like pressure in an ear. If there was nobody, would you know? Recalling events of loss, you remember voices you have once heard before this time of nothingness disappearing after their loss... Soon enough you hear the news. Am I insane? Who is this? Why is this happening? The subtle comfort of solidarity, though terrifying, luls me into comfort, still I hear this voice.... Still here alone..., where? We soon make plans. Rendezvous. Nobody cares when. We have all the time in the world right? Paris. France. That's the destination. The trip was not difficult, just long. Boats and gas are plentiful. Anyone... All two of them could break into the library now... There are so many... Finally here... I wait. Nobody. It never was... I was wrong. I have learned nothing. I still wait and look but there's nobody in sight... I guess this really is real life... I used to have this wish, and that some way, some how, I would meet her... Still getting played time and time again... I don't think it would end the way I hoped. We wouldn't meet. We wouldn't find love. There would be no hope, Or it would all be insanity from the start",0
"Everything has literally just went downhill in the past few months, especially my sleeping pattern. It's currently 7:35am and I'm pulling an all nighter in a desperate attempt to fix my sleeping schedule. Whenever I stay up past 2am I get severe anxiety at the thought of not being able to sleep and fucking up my schedule, which then keeps me awake even further and it sucks. In a state of panic I check all my social medias to see if anyone else is still up and if they are, it usually makes me feel a lot better. I don't know if my irregular sleep has anything to do with my extremely depressive recent state, but I just don't know where else to put this post. Anyone else share similar sleeping patterns? Not to mention I have exams in two weeks which is brilliant.",0
"I have been taking Mirtazapine 15mg for a month and the last 3 days I've been taking Mirtazapine 7.5mg to start to wean myself off them. Like 30 minutes ago, I had what I believe to be a seizure. I was taking a bath. When I got up to get out I felt dizzy, light-headed, and my vision started blacking out. I sat down on the toilet because I felt faint, and then all I can remember is waking up on the ground inbetween the toilet and my sink, twitching. I am wondering if this could have anything to do with me taking Mirtazapine? I know the obvious answer is go talk to your GP, but I can't get in until Thursday and I'm worried so I would like to figure out possible causes before I go. Thanks any help is appreciated. Also I don't know if this is the right subreddit to ask, but I figured it would be worth a shot.",0
"Is there any dating site or group for people with depression? Don't think that being single is the cause of my depression or dating the solution, but having someone to share time in that way would give a sense of stability to my life.

"Hey guys! I‚Äôm new here, and I have been hesitant to speak on this. My depression started around 3 years ago during my sophomore year in high school, and I‚Äôve tried to suppress it as much as possible, but unfortunately it still plagues me in small instances while being in my second semester of college. One of them that I can‚Äôt seem to shake, is not being interested in literally anything. I used to love video games, now I can‚Äôt play one for 5 minutes without getting bored or annoyed. I used to love skateboarding, and now I can‚Äôt stand to go out and do it. Can anyone give me tips or solutions?",0
The worst possible combination of words I want to hear from my mom. I‚Äôve been laying in bed all day and she was originally really nice checking in on me. Before she goes to bed she calls me a zombie and says I need to snap out of it before she commits me to the hospital. Which I reply yes please do. Just venting. Sorry.,0
"I've always been someone who has a small circle of very close friends and not much else and I'm fortunate that my current friends are wonderful people and very supportive of me, but I still feel very insecure in my relationships with them. Leaving high school has been very good for me, but I think to some extent I've sabotaged my own recovery and kept myself constantly sad out of fear that if I'm not in need of emotional support that my friends will leave me because I won't have anything to offer. Recognizing this has been good for me but I still am afraid that my friendships will naturally peter out because of my own deficiencies as a person. Does this make me a bad friend? I feel like I've been manipulative and an unnecessary burden and I don't know if that's a product of my own self-dislike or a reasonable reaction to my behavior.",1
"Three years ago my dad died, it hardly feels like three weeks. It's like everything else in my life is so insignificant in comparison, it's like a black hole that distorts my perception of time. It's as if time passes 100x faster since it and everything before it is so long ago. People say that after a major event in their life everything feels categorised into before and after it but to me it feels like things that are it and not, but most of them are. People have been telling me since then that I probably have depression and should maybe get help but that's mostly just from seeing me because I don't open up. I feel like I've just always been a little gloomy and don't feel very different now compared to before other than the whole bending of time thing. People say they noticed a change in me, but I didn't, maybe they just expect something like that to mess up a 14 year old?",0

Lately it feels like a haven't been doing enough with my life I have no job even though I've applied to a lot of places. I rarely leave the house now and I don't feel like I have the energy to leave I feel like a drone doing the same things everyday any advice on how to break this pattern?,0

"I‚Äôm suffering depression and anxiety, and I‚Äôm just ... sick of it. I was doing well, hanging out with my dad ... then my friend asked me how work was going and I just started crying again. This is so not me! I‚Äôm not a crier! I‚Äôm someone strong who can fucking do what needs to be done, when it needs to be done. I‚Äôm so sick of feeling weak and vulnerable. This is not who I am. And then when I went to acupuncture today. Again. Totally fine, toddling through life, walk into the acupuncturist‚Äôs office, he asks me how I‚Äôm going, and ... bam. Tears. I don‚Äôt mind crying when there‚Äôs a cause. And to be honest, I actually don‚Äôt usually cry when there IS a cause. So to be crying when there isn‚Äôt a viable cause ... it just feels pathetic. I had thoughts of suicide while at the acupuncturist. I don‚Äôt, usually, and I know that by putting it out there like this, there‚Äôs a greater chance that I won‚Äôt - I wouldn‚Äôt, anyway - but ... it‚Äôd be a lot easier for me. Not anyone else, I know. But it‚Äôd just stop everything for me. All I could think was life would be easier if I was a crow. I‚Äôm self medicating with St John‚Äôs Wort, Vitamins, Fish oil, turmeric and Chinese roots ... and most of the time I‚Äôm all right, but then - out of nowhere - tears. I don‚Äôt know what to do, how to be happy.",0
"I feel that I‚Äôve ran out of options today after my appointment with my shrink. I know there‚Äôs always the option of seeing another shrink but I‚Äôm not sure at all that I can summon the courage to do so. It took years and years of suffering to finally push me over the edge to see a shrink. To be fair, my shrink didn‚Äôt say or do anything out of line. She was courteous and patient, as usual. However as I sat there, I just felt very pointless. I‚Äôve felt like this all my life, what‚Äôs there to change it? What‚Äôs there to look to look forward to? I wish I could die.",0
"I watched The Greatest Showman the other day, and the song ‚ÄúA Million Dreams‚Äù made me cry so hard. It basically details the love story between the main character and his future wife. They talk about the big dreams they have, and the fact that they picture a world where these dreams come true helps them get through today. I just kept wishing that I had someone who loved me the way they loved each other. That I could have dreams that could actually become a reality someday. That I could be someone special instead of another sad lonely person waiting for a miracle that will never happen. I guess sometimes dreams are only meant to be dreams.",0
I'm having such a hard time dealing with lack of focus in my entire life. It makes me feel like garbage and a waste of space to grace this planet. I swear everyone around me has passions and potential and a drive to succeed in one area or another yet I have taken such a long time to come to terms with myself and its still not there! I'm surrounded by confidence and go getters and i know deep down that i could go and try and do all of these things that i want to experience but when push comes to shove i find it impossible to justify it or sometimes even remember what it was i wanted to do. This lack of passion for life gets me down every bloody day and I just want it to go away so that i can become comfortable with myself and have an casual epiphany that will allow me to move on a get on with my life.,1
"In the past two weeks, I haven't spoken to a soul. When I was a kid, people always said that I was chatty. It took me a long time to realize that I spoke all my thoughts trying to get the inability to have a conversation out of my system. It's years later and sometimes I think it's better to be alone. It takes so much for me to hold my self together. So much to not end my life. I hope someday I'll be glued back, or someone will help me carry the pieces. In reality, however, I'm constantly scared that if I let someone come close, they'll break me even more. It's like standing in front of a cracked mirror. The reality is distorted. Self image delusional. A few more cracks and it would all come falling down.",1

"Last week I got a new phone (Pixel 2, is vewy noice), and as I was setting it up, I realized that outside of family, I had no contacts to add. None. I don't know or have a single friend outside of my family. I've just been feeling worse since then. I tried to be optimistic about it, and to have my new year's resolution be some bullshit like ""talk to more people"" but I know that's not going to happen. I'm so socially awkward I can't start a conversation, and nobody wants to talk to me. I've also thought of talking to a therapist about it, but that will never happen. I can't see myself ever opening up about any of this in person. I just wish I could be able to literally just fucking talk to other people without being awkward, let alone have a single friend.",0
"I've had the ""there's so much for you to live for"" talk too many times. Everyone's advice is all the same. It's all so trivial. Eat healthy and exercise! I did. I started at 240 lbs. Got down to 180. Then I went on meds and went back to 220. Talk to people! I did. Now they don't talk to me or they're weird around me. Get professional help! I did. They either didn't know what to do or they told me to go talk to someone else in my government's healthcare. Take time for yourself! Ok I'm staring at a wall and my thoughts are racing now what? Journal! Tried that, ended up with me just bitching about my problems to myself. Wasn't very helpful Focus on your hobbies! Hard to do that when nothing interests me anymore. Make goals and follow through! Ok I did them now what? Take medication! I did. For almost a year. All it did was either do nothing, give me horrible anxiety in which I couldn't move, or didn't help and just made me gain weight. Also great to hear that depression never really goes away it just gets easier to manage. What's the point? Living life for the sake of living just seems pointless to me. There are so many people who'll say there's so much to live for or that it gets better. What if it doesn't? I don't really have anything to live for except for my pets who depend on me, but they won't care if I'm gone. It gets better is the biggest lie I've ever heard.",0
"My partner was diagnosed today with depression, he‚Äôs been prescribed Fluoxetine and counselling. He started the anti-drepessants today and tonight we had a stupid fight.

Background: we never fight, and he‚Äôs never slept apart from me like this. I don‚Äôt know if this is some sort of drug reaction or maybe he just has built up anger over today diagnoses?... but we‚Äôve never gone to bed with unsolved issues, let alone over something so silly.

"Indubitably, I am not worth anything as a being, contrary to the belief of all redditors who will reply to this, I have never once done anything correct in my life, all I have ever succeeded in has been to be hurtful and disrespectful to others and taking others for granted. All I breed is catastrophe. I am not at all talented or skilled at anything in particular, I am below average in every concept known to man. I have no motivation nor intention to progress in my life. I seem to be an inconvenience, an unpleasant burden towards society. I'd say my existence is more so comparable to a tumor, I am not productive and only produce negative effects on others that unfortunately have the unbearable pain that comes from interaction with someone like me. Entrapped in this body, I dream of going into eternal sleep, a great rest that lasts to the end of time. I do not have any interest in anything anymore, daily politics bore me a great deal and I'm not at all intrigued by life at all. I don't see a reason to not follow through with it when I have no intrinsic value and no drive nor intent to live at all.",1
"Almost everyday I wake up hating myself, why would I hate myself though? I graduated High School, have a loving and healthy family, have hobbies and online friends. Yet I find myself so paranoid and hateful of myself, why do I deserve this life I have? Sometimes I just wanna scream, feeling like I‚Äôm trapped in another person‚Äôs skin, I feel like all my accomplishments are fake and I am a useless slab of meat who‚Äôll eventually die. I dont have real life friends, post secondary, a job, a car or a license and the closest family I have is 6 hours away and barely talks to me. I want to be happy for the good things in my life but find hating myself all too easy. When I hate myself I feel selfish, like I am so self-absorbed that I only care about myself.

I made my son promise at Christmas to get help, and he did and he is thriving. My life long battle is starting to wear on this old soul of mine. It feels like the same pattern over and over, no matter how many variables I change. I am a very hard person to love. My scars and cynicism are just a little too hard for anyone who tries to stay around too long. Hubby has been in my atmosphere for 7 years...think it's finally getting through to him that I can not change the abuse I suffered, and the PTSD that resides in me and rears it's ugly head now and then. My mother never wanted me and beat her belly before I was ever born....almost 50 years later and I still feel as unlovable. I'm so tired.

"So I've been seeing a therapist for a couple of months now, and besides all the other upsides of therapy, I think my favorite and also most frustrating part is that my therapist confirmed that I am incredibly self-aware. To the point that she usually just agrees with me and I spend a lot of my sessions just talking to myself. Because I already know why my thoughts are irrational. I know I shouldn't let these things bother me. I know I'm not alone. I know this is an ongoing thing, I know, I know I know. And that's so frustrating. Because knowing doesnt make me feel any better. Knowing I need to learn how to like myself better and be okay to be alone doesnt help me actually get there. And when I get there, or think I've gotten there, I dont really feel any better. Yes, I'm lonely. I should learn to enjoy my own company and spend time with people who actually want to be with me. Great! Done that! Do this all the fucking time. But I feel the same. I'm still lonely. I still hate myself. Worst part is that I cant even blame anyone or anything. I did this. I'm doing this. I'm the problem. My therapist part of the problem is that I overthink and keep having these expectations for myself. That I should try to just ""do"" what feels right. But I already do that. If anything, I do it too much. That's why I'm starting to accumulate so much junk in my house. Idk. I just wanted to let the usual ramblings in my head out somewhere. I'm tired.",1

Maybe if i had a garden and if i had to hunting, anything but this. I dont want to live this way.

"I reached my limit, nothing helps anymore, I tried everything I could get my hands on. My family doesn't even believe in depression. I'm just a big fat dumb loser, but it doesn't matter anymore, because tomorrow I'll put an end to all of this. I don't know why I'm even posting this, I'm so desperate that I've reached out to Reddit hoping that by some miracle Reddit would have a solution to my problem. Eitherway have a goodnight.",0
"I'm about done here, its time for me to punch out. No friends, no career and no passion for anything. I moved from Texas to my hometown in Wisconsin because it was the last place I actually remember being happy but I've been here for a year now and nothing has changed. It's been so long now that I've felt like an entirely useless waste of space. My family doesn't even care about me anymore but I still want to write something to my mom just so she hears it from me and not a phone call by the police. I just want to apologize for all the time and money wasted on me, I turned out to be such a disappointment and I just want to be gone. I'm saving up for a neat looking revolver so I can at least go out with a bang. I just don't know what to put in the text to my mom,I mean how can I just say that I give up, that the world wins, that they were right about me",1
Does anyone feel like the only person that could understand your depression would be someone else that was depressed? But also feel like if they were to date someone who was depressed they couldn't handle it because it might suck you into a place that you don't want to be in again.,0
"This might sound ridiculous, but I want to die, and I'm not severely depressed. I'm approaching this purely philosophically. The way I see it, my life is more suffering than joy, and that's probably not going to change. In fact, I would say this is true of most people. We spend most of our time doing things we don't want to do: working, cleaning, driving in traffic, feeling hungry, experiencing physical discomfort, etc, etc. Why would it not be better to not exist at all (I don't believe in an afterlife) rather than experience the totality of consciousness? Now other people will mourn my death, this much is true. But they're going to mourn my death regardless of when it happens. No mourning is avoided by making it happen now. If anything, I'm at a point in my life when no one is dependent on me and my death will have the smallest impact it probably ever will. So why not die?",0
"I had enough to drink that it doesn't hurt, still know what i have to do. Drove my support people further away so they're safe. It's about that time.",0

"So after some deep soul searching the past couple of days i have come to the conclusion that i am still self harming (29/F) but not by cutting myself like i used to when i was very young. I seem to have created this character, or other personality i suppose? Where i just want to fight everyone, and I won‚Äôt back down, i‚Äôm not normally a fighter and every single time i hate myself for my behaviour the day after. I guess my thinking is that if i get myself into fights, i‚Äôm going to get hurt and a part of me is hoping to be seriously injured so i can just have a break from life üôÑ Anyone else have any odd things they do during a low period?",1
"I have lost everything, i dont have any reason to live. Im in so much pain, its a constant unending agony. I dont want to live. I am only 16, i should have a full life ahead of me, instead i dont have anything. Id be better off giving up. Its all too much, i dont know why i havent killed myself already, i dont want to live, i just havent bothered to die yet.",0
"I was going to a doctor who just wanted to prescribe medication, but none of it seemed to really help. And my previous doctor was the same. I tried with no luck to self refer to some mental health places but nothing panned out. I changed insurance recently and had to switch doctors. They referred me to a place which both me and my doctor were under the impression would handle medication and therapy. So I scheduled a needs assessment and thought, ""finally."" But after the needs assessment they just wanted to refer me to more places. I tried calling most of them and they were either full with long wait lists, no longer existed(maybe wrong number provided) or no answer. I called my doctor back and they sent a referral to another place, and told me I should get a call within the week. Its been 3 weeks now and no call. Im starting to think finding treatment is hopeless. And jumping through hoops just to find a potential match is just draining.",0
"It would be nice to hear from other people what you‚Äôre experiences have been like. When I‚Äôm on my own or with people I‚Äôm comfortable around, I‚Äôm ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù My version of happy and normal anyway, whatever that looks like with depression wrapped in. Then, when I go out in social situations, I‚Äôm someone else. I‚Äôm frantic, I try too hard to be funny, etc. I‚Äôm socially anxious, I guess that‚Äôs the point. But I find these opposites in writing too. When I‚Äôm writing I‚Äôm intelligent, I have a lot to say and offer people. But when I speak directly to people I clam up. I have a tiny vocabulary. I swear a lot. I saw the same words/phrases over and over. None of these things is particularly bad on their own but together it translates into me being a fucking mess. Do you ever find you‚Äôre two different people?",1
"I hate being undesirable. I hate looking at myself in the mirror. Hopefully with this new haircut I could not look as untouchable. Especially since no one has liked me, I feel so pathetic in a way. I‚Äôm just ranting. I was sitting and thinking how bad I feel about my appearance and how much I try to be better. I got slimmer, got more muscle, haircut and all. All around, it‚Äôs a nightmare. It‚Äôs late and all I think about these hours are either suicide or imagining I am someone else. When I can, I fantasize about how my day would be different if I was a new man. I would look better, have friends, a girlfriend, a full loving and able-bodied family, nice house, etc. I guess it‚Äôs just the land of dreams for me until I die.",1
"My health, both mental and physical, have been going down hill since December. My life is on hold, I can't do anything, I hate feeling useless. My family yells and screams at me because I'm depressed. They call me lazy and a loser, then question why I dont talk to them about my mental health. It's the two faced nature of them that really gets to me. I'm tired of fighting everything. I have zero support, no friends, nothing but pain. I want it to end, I'm starting to plan out how I want to go. I would go to a hotel to kill myself but I dont have any money because I've been off work. Theres so many people I want to reach out to but I burn all my bridges. Fuck I'm so alone, I can't do this anymore. I hate myself",1
Ive been struggling with depression for the last 2 years and i dont want to keep living but i dont want to die i feel very alone and sad every day and it feels like theres only one way out. But i dont want to die. I dont expect anyone to care or understand what im feeling or understand what im going through. I just wanted to share this to see if i can feel less lonely for once. This is my cry for help. I need help.,0
"I really don't get it. My life has been in a downward spiral for over a year in a half. I lost my sister to a car accident in January 2019, then my pet of ten years just three months later. Then I lose my home another six month later and now just this week I lose my job. I'm so tired of this life and I just want to die. I wish for the courage to kill myself but then I think about the burden that would put on my family. I hate this world and everything about it. I really wish I could be killed in a car wreck or something like that so I could get what I want and my family wouldn't be burden by my sorry existence.",0
"Hey can any of you all relate to this? I‚Äôm 22 year old male . My Parents divorced when I was 13. While they were married, my siblings and I witnessed verbal abuse, threats, dad pushed our mom, mom crying, dad coming home drunk, and even after the divorce they constantly talked bad about each other . Since the divorce, I became really sad and it follows me until this day. Some days I‚Äôm happy and then there are days where I cry myself to bed. The day they divorced, police had to come to the house because my dad was trying to hurt my mom. Soon after I witnessed my younger brother change from an innocent child to a drug addict. My father was an alcoholic who is now dead. My mother had the nerve to say to me ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt why your brother is like this... he didn‚Äôt have it that bad.‚Äù My mom really doesn‚Äôt know the trauma she caused me and my brother. My brother was vulnerable. He needed someone but I was too young to realize he needed help. Not until now . I was gone In the military when he spiraled out of control. Do you all think my mother was right to say that to me about my own brother?",0
"My closest friends have been distant lately. Mostly busy with their jobs, other friends, or partners. I feel they don't really care about me as they're hard to get in contact with. If I gave in to my depression, would they even care that I'm dead?",0
It seems I've finally come to realise that I've become a monster i thought i was originally preventing becoming one but really i became one a long time ago. I keep hurting the people i love saying things that i shouldn't and now trying to suppress my emotions. I've become something i feared of becoming and now that the realization has kicked in I'm not sure what to do I'm panicking,0
I'm pretty sure I'm depressed but my parents don't believe in mental health and I'm too afraid to like go to a school counselor cuz my parents will ground me for just wanting attention or something. I wanna get better but I don't think I can without help of some sort. people say that meds suck and therapists suck and stuff but I feel like anything Is better than how I feel. I feel I need help but I don't know how to get it,0
"I'm supposed to kill myself on my 20th birthday. On some days, the only reason that I even function is the thought of me killing myself in the near future. I really can't wait for it. My whole life is starting to fall apart slowly and slowly. My whole body feels so tired and just wants to rest.",0
"I didn't get into med school. My boyfriend is mad and ""disappointed"" in me because I won't tell my parents. He thinks my family can do something because I have connections to a school. I don't want my family to contact the school because if I didn't get in I don't deserve to get in. I'm just a disappointment to everyone. I don't deserve anything. If I'm not smart enough to get into grad school I don't want to live anymore anyways. If I'm not smart I'm not worthy of living.",1
"Our relationship was the best up until the 19th of February. I let my insecurities, fears and depression get me and I overwhelmed him. I drove him away and now it feels like we dont know each other. all our conversations are one sided. I haven't seen him for weeks except for the two times I asked to talk to him. I'm in a worse state and the only way I can win him back is to get stronger but I cant. every day I come home, lay on my bed, stare at the wall, cry and remember this all my fault. He's a good person and he doesn't deserve someone ruining his happiness. today I'm preparing myself to let him go. I love him with all my heart but I cant stand it anymore. I want to get stronger but I just cant. All my friends dont know about it because I dont want to overwhelm them like how I did with him. Again, I felt alone. And I hated it. Why couldnt I be happy like 2 months ago? Why did this sadness come back? This is much stronger than what I felt for the past 11 years. Buy when the day comes where we part. I dont think I'll ever truly be myself. I made myself worse. And I just let it happen. I keep making myself worse. I hate myself for that. I really want it to work out, but maybe it's too late for that. the damage is done.",1
I‚Äôve reached a new point in hating myself I constantly feel as if I am worthless and not good enough. I think about the days where I could just wake up and be happy and how I‚Äôll never feel that again my life‚Äôs been hell for 3 years. I am not good enough for any girls because my body is disgusting and I can‚Äôt speak to them to save my life. I truly have no worth so little that my dad doesnt even love me. I‚Äôll be graduating hs in a few months and I‚Äôm scared because I know I‚Äôll fuck up my whole life with my shitty decision making why the fuck did I have to be alive,1
"Life was really great but then things just completely changed and now life is just really horrible. I find myself thinking about suicide more often, and I thought about it before during a bad time, but now I‚Äôm just more sure that I‚Äôm gonna do it and I‚Äôm kind of relieved about it. I can imagine myself about to die, and I‚Äôm not as fearful as before. Anyways, I‚Äôm thinking of making a plan soon, and I‚Äôm thinking about hanging or maybe even using hydrogen sulfide (detergent suicide). If anyone knows anything about using hydrogen sulfide and any discomfort associated with it, I‚Äôd appreciate learning about it :) I‚Äôm so exhausted guys, I just wish I had someone to talk to but I feel like I just get this weird feeling that stops me from talking about it to a specific person. I hope I can end things peacefully. Thanks for reading.",0
"Let me start of by saying I'm not diagnosed, I haven't really experienced any traumatic incidents in my life and I have no intention of harming myself. However, due to events in recent months, I feel so empty, like I don't give a fuck about doing anything. Even feeding myself has become something I try to avoid. I don't take care of my appearance, I do the minimal work I need to get by and I rarely socialize with the few friends I have. These are part in part to a belief that has formed in my head: life is meaningless. What is the point of doing anything? We slave away through school, to get a place at university, then we slave away through uni to get a good degree, then we slave away in a job we will probably hate to make sure we don't end up on the streets. All this, all this pointless cycle and in the grand scheme if things, it makes no difference. I think a lot of times to myself, if I were to disappear now, would anything be affected? Have I had any impact at all on the world? Will I even be remembered? The answers are always no. This has produced an emptiness inside me. The emptiness leads to a lack of people, activities and more, which in turn leave me feeling lonely and unfulfilled respectively. Yet I again feel a lack of desire to do anything. I don't know what this is or why I think like this, but I would appreciate it if anyone could give me some sort of method or exercise to break this cycle.",0
A terminal disease looks like it's my only escape. Going to focus on getting terminal cancer or maybe sudden death due to heart problems. Wish me luck. I'm serious. I'm done with life.,0
"So life is okay pretty good I guess wish we made more money but I‚Äôm happy. Or I‚Äôm not. Doesn‚Äôt matter I still feel the very VERY strong need to kill myself and it lasts for a while like a week or for a short term like a few hours. Sometimes I feel like I have to slit my wrists in a tub or put that bullet in my brain or swerve into a truck but I know better. It‚Äôs something in my brain that is triggering this. I am a Christian a real one and I ask God at times to take this from me and it helps but it‚Äôs like a voice a little guy on my shoulder waiting and watching and anything can trigger it. UHG! So frustrating. I think about how my dog, my husband, my brother sister and nieces and nephews need me but the voice doesn‚Äôt care. I was just wondering if there is a part in the brain that does this? I have never done hard core drugs but my mother was high on speed when she was pregnant with me... and she has a dopamine issue because of all the drugs and falls into deep depressions or gets suicidal from it. Maybe it‚Äôs hereditary or maybe because of the drugs she did when pregnant caused the issue with my brain? Anyway any thoughts would be helpful thank you in advance.",0
"7 units are ending this week, so I won‚Äôt be nearly suffering as much. Thank God. I‚Äôm so exhausted and energy deprived. I really hope this has been worth it...I‚Äôm transferring to university early in the fall and I‚Äôm terrified of it",0
"I can never have a meaningful relationship with anyone, romantically or otherwise. I'm too fucked to make a lasting impression one anyone other than the lost puppy who follows people around hoping for some attention, or a good lay but nothing worth taking to me your friends and family. I'm not looking for pity I just have no one to voice this too. I always feel looked over, left behind, or just plain snubbed altogether. At this point in my life (mid 30s) I'm just done trying and it hurts. I enjoy myself, my hobbies and my alone time. But that is literally all I have other than work. I'm just feeling betrayed and hurt by someone I have always been there for and I just don't want to go through this again and again. I'm just done.",0

I'm away from my family and I don't even have time to visit. I'm barely holding on now. I can't focus in class and I feel like crying even in class itself.

"I'm 18 years old. I lost my car and my job. I had to move in with my boyfriend as a last resort but I'm very close to him kicking me out. My boyfriend resents me for moving in with him. I have nowhere else to go after that. I'm 3 months away from graduation but in order to tolerate school I have to show up high as a kite. So many people there hate me. The work is just piling up and I cry in class almost once a week it seems. I had one shot at a decent job and I didn't get it. There's nowhere else near me where I can apply. But my boyfriend got a job at the same place. I'm volatile and emotional. I hurt everyone around me. I've driven everyone away. I have literally, and I mean literally, no one. I don't know why I'm like this. All I do is make other's lives hell. Fuck I want to die. I want to die as painfully as I can. I want to be flayed, burned, and disemboweled. It's what I deserve in life. I've caused so much pain for everyone around me. I fucking hate myself beyond words. I can't think of anyone I hate more than myself. I just want to die.

I used to bottle things up. Hope they would just pass without causing any problems... they usually would and because of that I thought it would be a good way to deal with stress and all of that. I was wrong. Ever since I tried being more and meeting more people and making my life more exciting it just hasn‚Äôt worked. If anything it made things worse. Stuff just keeps getting added to my bottle and now the cap doesn‚Äôt even fit on the top. It‚Äôs affecting the people I‚Äôm around and I don‚Äôt like it but I also don‚Äôt want to tell them what is wrong because I don‚Äôt want them to worry or be concerned. My feelings are leaking and I don‚Äôt like it because they are noticing. I feel like I‚Äôm doing more harm to them by not telling them. I just want everyone to be ok but I don‚Äôt want them to know...suicide has been a very present thought in my head but I don‚Äôt want to leave...it would just hurt them more..hopefully my thoughts on that won‚Äôt change or else I won‚Äôt be here for long...

"Feel free to downvote me into oblivion or to just move on. I just can‚Äôt do it myself. I want to die. In fact, I can‚Äôt actually envision a future for myself. The way some people see themselves getting married, having a career they love, having children, etc., I just don‚Äôt see that for myself. Instead, I only see myself dead. Sadly, I don‚Äôt have the strength or fortitude to end my own life. I have a plan for ending it all, but I just don‚Äôt think I could actually follow through with it. I have a fear of commitment, and committing to that decision is something I just can‚Äôt do. Several times everyday, I daydream about someone walking up to me and killing me. If someone else did it for me, it would make things so much better. Ironically, this makes me want to self harm, but self harming itself has left me with scars that make me feel worse about myself which, in turn, makes me want to end my life or self harm more. Despite what a lot of people say (or will say), I just don‚Äôt think there is a reason for me to continue living.",0
"I (edit : 20f college student ) hate it the feeling of waking up everyday with the same two thoughts "" I wish I never woke up. Oh well another day that I can't wait till it's over"" I feel empty emotionless and sad I have been feeling like this for years(4 years). I thought about ending it millions of times. It's still tempting to this day. I wish I would have someone to talk to but I don't want to burden anyone with my feelings. I hate myself and everything around me and these days it's been getting worse and worse. More emotionless and more empty. I want to cry but I literally can't find tears. The problem is I don't even know what's wrong with me or what's bothering me or how to fix it. I feel so alone. I am an introvert with hard times expressing what my feelings are. And whenever someone notices something is wrong I have the tendancy to avoid them / put alot more distance. This is my second week of only sleeping 3 hours a day...

"Hi so I would like to know what's your opinion on this. So there was an activity at my college, in which students from different schools were coming the univ to see it and explore it. When they came, the college gave them a ticket to get a free meal. We, students of the college itself, are really unhappy with the university because they always have money for anything but the university itself, charging us a lot of money for things that are not there. So we, unleashed, decided to take back what's ours. One guy printed out a lot (maybe like 15-20) tickets of the food and we went there to get the food by ourselves. So at the end of the day, the food was done earlier than usual. We did it only for 2 days out of the 3 days the whole college stuff was happening. We didnt do it the last day cause they realized something was wrong and printed out a different ticket. So we didnt go, also because they were being suspicious and asking questions. Do you think we are getting punished?it was only like 25 juice boxes and sandwiches, that's it, out of the probably 200 or 300 there were there. This has me so preoccupied omg.",0

"Actually I like living but not with this situations. I'm 17 now, today is my birthday. I have mental ilnesses for my childood, when I was 11 my ocd starts. And I have depression for several years. Sometimes it's go up and sometimes down. In 7th grade I sleep all day. And this year I'm actually be aware of my depression. And I have paranoia too, ever since last year. I took antidepressant and antipsychotics. And this time I take 2 capsule prozac every moening. And also I'm going to psychiatrist. First time I've go to psychiatrist is nearly 3 years ago. And I'm going to psychologyst too in last 3 years (not continuonus). But I can't be happy. Always I'm thinking something. I can't be relax. I can't be peaceful.

"I am use to depression causing me to eat tons of food. I self medicate that way, even with meds and therapy- food is usually the only thing that can distract me. Now, however, food is bland and gross. I get no satisfaction from it at all and now just eat once a day because *science* says it gives me energy. Now I feel unsatisfied. It was the last thing I still enjoyed. I can‚Äôt read, I can‚Äôt write, my musical instruments (cello, piano, guitar) are literally gathering dust. I stopped playing video games that require thought, I haven‚Äôt sung in half a year. I hav n‚Äôt drawn since before Christmas. Is this life now?",0
Im literally not good at anything... I have no skills whatsoever. Im 19 and I still live off my parents money. I have no job. I don't go to school. Everytime I try to better myself I give up halfway. Im the biggest disappointment ever. I just fucking hate it. I wish I were just dead already.,1
"The summer of 2019 I started developing severe OCD after suffering from mild, unnoticeable OCD for many years. I just feel so tired of things, so bored of living, but I can't commit suicide. I know that there are people who care about about me, like my parents, and the shit they would have to go trough if I commited suicide is unbearable for me to imagine. But I just wished I didn't exist, that I never was born. I wish I could vanish from this world, be gone like the wind. I often wish I would die in an accident or disease, because maybe that would be less painful for the people around me then if I would commit suicide. I have stayed home from school for about 2 months because of illness related to the stress, not stress from school, but from my mental health. I feel crippled. One day I woke up and was completely emotionally numb. I couldn't feel happiness, sadness, anger or any other emotion, but it got better. But I really wished it wouldn't have gotten better, it was ""amazing"", I couldn't either feel anxiety so all I felt was blank. When I think about the meaning of life I always come to the conclusion that I want to marry a wonderful woman, have kids and grow old and die of old age, and this is the other thing keeping me alive. That was my story.",0
"I'm posting here because its anonymous and frankly I just wanted to speak my piece before I end it. I feel awful inside, everyday trying to mask the pain with busy work, or arrogance and charm towsrds others to distract myself. I've felt empty for quite some time. I finally opened up to my wife about these thoughts a year ago and she blamed me for how that made her feel knowing I want to kill myself. She left me some short time after. Since then I've had about 6 months of time to really digest my thoughts and feeling. I feel an incredible depression each day and then feel even worse when I think about my children having to deal with my death. For a long time that deterred me from suicide, now it seems more like a valid solution to my pain and a way for everyone to move on. I dont want anyone to find my body which clearly describes suicide. On the contrary I'd like to frame my death so the narrative suggests a noble death and therefore easier on my family. Of course my children love me, but it's been an incredibly long time since I've felt love or purpose. I feel like a paycheck, a slave to everyone else's needs, a pawn in someone else's game. I'm happy that I experienced love, excitement, danger, success but I feel now at the age of 35 the good days of ignorant bliss are behind me. Anyway, just figured I'd put this out here, to people that wouldn't tell me how selfish I am, or how this doesnt help anyone. I just want the pain to end.",0
"I‚Äôm very depressed. I‚Äôm also an antinatalist. And I‚Äôm also a nihilist. So, I do not think there is a point to living. Furthermore, I wish I was never born.

"For a few months it's been overwhelming. I've lost multiple friends in the last two months alone due to how I act. I dont think I'm exactly wrong, but I only kept about 2 to 3 friends and now they just wont contact me. I feel insignificant contacting them because I've only gotten a response once or twice. I'm falling out of my work schedule, every night thinking of how I would end myself until i realize I'm thinking about it. The past six months have been so hard on me, and I'm only 20. I know i have many years more to live but it feels so hopeless as i think that I'm gonna die one day, why keep feeling like this forever? I feel like I have no hold over my life, I cant stay in one place for long, much less keep a steady job. In the moment I just say fuck it and quit and move on to another, I dropped out and am an alcoholic. I cant clean because it feels hopeless as well, everything just piles up until I'm at this point, and this time i dont know if i can move on. My dreams are repetitive and of the same person, and i cant shake that no matter what i try. Right now just seems like the time to save my family the pain of doing it later and just ending it. I dont know what to do. I want to make an impact on the world but know the chances are oh so slim, and it seems a lot easier to die.",0
"So basically for a while ive been unable to feel emotions. I can see horrible things without feeling bad, I cant be happy and I cant have fun and I just feel dead inside. but I have a teacher that I really liked for a while now. (idk if I loved her or not, I didnt feel anything) I loved talking with her and I always looked forward to the next day and every time I stopped talking with her I got a bit down I guess and every time she smiled it made me smile. But idk, its not like that anymore. I dont really care about her anymore, I dont look forward to tomorrow anymore and seeing her again everyday is not the same. I think my depression/emotional numbness killed my ""love"" for her. living sucks.",0
"I'm a 23 year old unemployed woman still living with my mom. I quit my job 3 months ago because of the stress and anxiety it was putting me through. Of late my mental health has worsened a lot and I can't seem to get out of the loop. Everything makes me cry and I don't even feel like going out of my room most days. I go to a psychiatrist and I am on meds but nothing seems to be working. (Ive changed almost 7 therapists/psychiatrists now because my mental health was showing no improvement.) I feel like a parasite, latching on to my mother and aunts for financial support. I want to move out and live independently but I don't even feel anything. I don't feel like doing anything, let alone wanting to work. I constantly worry whether I'm just being lazy and making excuses or whether I genuinely have a problem. I don't want to face people, give interviews or work among other people. Everytime I get a job I end up having panic attacks and excessively stressing out. The thought of having responsibility and knowing that there are certain expectations I have to meet while working, and the constant anxiety of doing badly at my job trouble me so much. I don't want to go through any of this. I don't want to. I don't want to do anything. I'm tired of being taunted by everyone and having to dodge questions about why I'm still unemployed. I feel useless and worthless and I don't know how to get out of this cycle.",1

She doesn't care for me anymore. I'm going to die alone and uncared for. I don't see a reason to keep going on with life. I might as well skip years of agony.

"sorry that seems obvious if your depressed. But like, I'm to tired to put makeup on. For the last 10 months. I'm normally a wake and face kinda gal. I gave up my job to go back to school full time after the birth of my youngest. Childcare is so expensive it's not worth it! So I am at home. Which I love? But hate.

When you are there for everyone when they need you but you have nobody when you need them. Ironically you cry yourself to sleep wishing someone would help you through the pain but it's never gonna be like that.,0
"So I‚Äôve been depressed since about 4. Started cutting around 12, the same time I had my first flashback to the first time I was raped. I made serval attempts since I was 16, never really trying hard enough. But tonight I really really really wanted to do it. I tried cutting myself but the knife I got wasn‚Äôt sharp enough... my boyfriend ended up calling me in the middle of everything. So I talked to him about it, I was on hold with the suicide hotline anyways. I guess I didn‚Äôt REALLY want to otherwise it would‚Äôve worked? I‚Äôve always heard of people just cutting, but it ends up going too deep and that‚Äôs how they almost die. Don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm writing this.. actually I do I want to hear from someone. Encouragement, your story, anything. Update: I‚Äôm at my boyfriends house now and I have therapy on Saturday so I‚Äôm gonna talk to my therapist about all of this then.

"I don‚Äôt know why but, ever since the breakup with my ex 2 months ago, I‚Äôve been feeling more alone, more suicidal. I was by no means not suicidal before the relationship or during the relationship but now I‚Äôm out of it, I feel cold, alone and suicidal a lot more. Something about being held and comforted by someone who I actually loved was peaceful. I‚Äôm a very heavy guy (16 stone heavy) so I‚Äôve always found Bad luck in relationships. Due to this and the countless bullying I suffered due to my weight, I‚Äôve been very depressed and suicidal, and when a person comes into my life, I just get attached to them easily. I just feel like I‚Äôm worthless, like I don‚Äôt deserve the happiness I want to have. In times like this I just want someone to lay down with me, cuddle with me, and reassure me they won‚Äôt leave me and won‚Äôt hurt me.

I hate school, and I‚Äôm in an apprenticeship that my dad talked me into which I have never been into construction and now I know I absolutely hate it but my dad wont let me quit. At the same time I cannot see myself having a future or being happy in the future. I would have killed myself a long time ago but my family would be sad so I‚Äôm stuck chugging along and being miserable.",1
I've been suicidal in the past and really thought I was better. For some reason started thinking about all the bad/hurtful things I've done to people and within like a week went from feeling generally good to researching ways to kill myself. I feel like a shit person and like there's no good reason for me to live. I just want to stop feeling guilty and I don't know how to do that except kill myself. And I feel like I would kind of deserve it. I'm scared that even if I make it through this I'm just doomed to being suicidal all my life and eventually I'll be impulsive enough to do it. Even just thinking this way makes me feel guilty because I know how much being suicidal hurts and scares my friends and family. I feel like a bad person for reaching out for help.,0

"I just can't anymore, my friend that been supporting me to this very moment, she is really kind and I am sorry for what I am about to say but I just don't see the point why shouldn't I just kill myself. I am giving up I just can't bear this anymore. The pressure is too much and I am just so tired of trying over and over and over again. Whatever I do whoever I try to ask nothing will happen. I just don't really see the point why should I keep pushing and keep trying. I haven't slept in days, didn't eat or just did anything productive like homework I have to do. I just don't really see the point right now. Why? Please tell me why? Why?! Nobody cares! My family doesn't I care! I don't have any friends! I am all alone in this! Why am I the only one that suffers! I am always the blamed one! Just... WHY. Nobody can help me. I am all alone in this deep shit. I have no idea what to do next in my life. There is no point no reason nothing matters we all are going to die so why to live in the first place? I am sorry",0
"The stability in my mental health comes and goes and right now it‚Äôs particularly bad. I have suffered from mental health issues since I was a child, and it was particularly bad in my teenage years. Mental illness along with multiple suicide attempts destroyed my memory, and I feel like losing my teenage years to mental illness impaired me as an adult. I‚Äôm in university now, I do my work, get decent grades, but I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing. I don‚Äôt enjoy anything, my program is okay but I don‚Äôt see my future like so many people do. I struggle to make real connections with people, I am so emotionally unavailable and have hurt so many people leading them on and being unable to commit to them. I also barely enjoy sex and am traumatized from being sexually assaulted after a graduation party. I am wasting away my young adult years now, and soon enough I‚Äôll regret not doing anything with my time. Therapy has never worked for me. I can safely say that I am a ghost of who I was, and who I could‚Äôve been. I pretend and pretend but this part of me always seeps through the cracks. I want it to all end but I don‚Äôt think I could ever die, I am an only child and only daughter and it would tear my family apart. I‚Äôm just stuck. I‚Äôll never be who I want to be and I feel like I have no options",0
I stopped being able to watch movies months ago. Now I‚Äôm finding myself in conversations I and I have no idea what we‚Äôre talking about.

"I'm generally good at hiding it, but I just don't like the way my headspace has been going lately. Moving away from friends and attending a new school has hit hard, I haven't been able to connect with many people. I've lost motivation to do even the smallest simplest things.

So for the past year and a half I've not been doing well. Certain traumatic events happened that had a lot more impact on me than I realized they did in the moment. This paired with health issues has me becoming more and more depressed and the good moments are far and between. This is what made finally take this step because I could not go on the way I was just existing. So we will see if this is a good step in the direction of finally getting better.,0
"I‚Äôve been diagnosed with this and that etc but day to day I try and play devils advocate with myself because my motivation is at maximum low. What part of my behavior is due to mental illness and what part is due to being lazy I shit on myself all the time. There‚Äôs things I can physically literally do, like clean my room, put sheets on my bed, shower or whatever but when it comes down to it I put myself in a hole. There‚Äôs times where I get so suicidal that once those thoughts pass and time heals or whatever the fuck I‚Äôm left to not give a shit about anything because in my head I should be dead and whatever good happens to me in my life in the future was luck and the rest was destined. Something like that. I hate articulating",1
"My parents fight all the time, Idk if ive been verbally abused or what but my mother yells at me a lot, typically calls me a little shit. i dont really give a fuck about that its just middle school man.

I really scared myself last week though, had my first suicidal thought. Im not trying to commit suicide yet, the thought has just crossed my mind and i kinda wanna talk about it",0
If nothing changes by the end of the year I've decided to kill myself. I can't live like this anymore. I'm so tried. I'm sick of failing in life again and again and again I'm sick of people calling me crazy I'm of being treated like crap I'm sick of life. If nothing changes by the end of the year I plan on killing myself before I turn 20. IM SO TRIED I WANT IT TO END I WANT RELIEF,0
I really am having a hard time with life. Nothing in my life seems worth achieving or working for. I'm emotionally filled with self hatred to the point where I just want to end it all.

I can't even talk to my professors because I always get the same response, ""if I help you, I have to help others."" What's the point?

He said ""I will never forget you, but we will never see each other again"" as if I had already died. He knows I will. He acts like I'm already gone.

I'm at a point where I've seen no light at the end of the tunnel for quite a while. I've lightly thought about just ending it for some time as well. Tonight I feel it like never before. Still though there is a voice telling me that's stupid and of course I can't do that. But I'm scared that voice will go away someday? I don't know. I don't know how it works. I just want to feel okay again. I looked at some old photos today and there was one where I realized that was the last time I truly felt good.

She wrote me on a piece of paper ways to feel better and never end up in the hospital again, along with her number if I need anything. 3 years later I want to kill myself again, I want to call her but I feel bad unloading my baggage on a random person who probably doesnt even remember I exist. I have no one else. I dont know what to do. I just cut my thighs I wanna shove the switch blade into my throat and I have no one to call besides this random girl who showed me kindness 3 years ago in a loony bin",0

"Very painfully (for me) over the past few months I've lost my best friend. Despite my trying to make things better I couldn't salvage things. We've gone from a really good friendship to barely talking at the end of the day, mostly because of routine. I still care about this person greatly, but its pretty clear thats not the case for this person Over that time period, my mental state has just gone down the drain. This person was really my only reason to get out of bed in the morning, and be the best version of me that I can be. I've gone from an A student, to a B student, to a C student, and now im having trouble bringing myself to do any schoolwork at all. I just want to lay down and sleep, even though im getting less than 5 hours a night. I've been having suicidal thoughts for the past month and I honestly dont know how much longer I can hold out, with the lonliness and the stress given for being an academic student (Canadian system) I've always been more of a lonely kid, but over this friendship I was shown how much greener the grass is when you have someone to talk to, someone that (seems) to enjoy your company, and can make you smile.",0
"I've always seen pills as the ""cry for help"" suicide method, but at the same time, I've also heard about people who take some pills, drink some Jack Daniels and peacefully die in their sleep. How deadly is this suicide method really? What are the chances that someone who tries this method ends up waking up feeling sick rather than dying without realizing it?",0

"All the time I've lost to this disease, the contribution it's made to awful sleep, insomnia, and bad health in general. I wonder how many days, or how much time it's stolen and continuing to steal from my life? Do I get to suffer for decades and then die early too, maybe when it's just starting to be light. I'm really not sure. It sucks having problems that damage your mind thrust into your life that are beyond your control. I was pretty normal, and I don't know I'll ever get close to it again. It's such a long and painful journey that no one sees, and no one understands.",0
"I wake up every morning not wanting to exist. My dad died last month and now I can‚Äôt get these thoughts out of my head. He had been depressed for a long time and we often talked about mental health with each other. His mother had committed suicide via overdose when he was quite young. He died of natural causes in his sleep, and I just want to join him. I want to find the power to continue living but every day is a battle and I just don‚Äôt know how to cope anymore. My thoughts have been getting darker and darker by the day and I‚Äôm beginning to fear myself. I‚Äôd like to reach out to people for help but I‚Äôve never been able to do that; I feel like I have a mental barrier and just can‚Äôt get past it to better myself.

"I want to die. I‚Äôm tired of feeling this way inside and not being about to tell anyone. My friends have their own issues, depression, substance use, family issue. My situation in life it pretty good, I know this. Objectively, I can see it but this feeling that I carry inside is too much. This echoing nothing that carries on from day to day, the overwhelming sadness, the worthlessness... its all too much. I think about my family and then I feel guilt.. who would find me , who would clean up? Who would pack my shit away or sell it? The damage it would do to my mother only adds to the guilt. But there‚Äôs no way I can stay, living like this hurts. I‚Äôm head over heels for someone and every minute I spend with them is lovely. I makes things a little bit easier. But I can feel that my presence is too much sometimes, and the guilt come rushing in. I don‚Äôt know how long I can keep this up.",0
"I‚Äôve been suffering from depression and anxiety since like 8th grade. I was molested when I was younger which definitely doesn‚Äôt help but honestly I just wanna kill myself cause of my current situation. I just feel so lonely and just downright defeated honestly. I thought I‚Äôve been getting better but realized that I‚Äôm actually just regressing in different ways. Instead of being sad about my problems I laugh them off and ignore them leaving them there, instead of being too open with my friends driving them away I now have serious problems not being able to express that I care about people. It‚Äôs to the point that apparently (someone else pointed this out) I physically shake when I begin talking about anything wrong with myself. I‚Äôm so fucking sick of this you‚Äôd think of after 4 YEARS of consistently fighting and trying everything (medicine, mediation, therapy) NOTHING has been accomplished. I always feel like an outsider looking in, never really belonging. Sometimes I think my friends secretly don‚Äôt like me and I don‚Äôt blame them. How could you like someone who can‚Äôt express that they care about you. Never been in an actual relationship, to the point to where when my entire workplace realized I probably wasn‚Äôt going to prom so my friend volunteered to go with me which to me feels like a complete pity act as she does have a boyfriend. So I think my current plans are I‚Äôll take this last month to get everything in place, have a great time at prom, and overdose on something (probably alcohol). College life and adult work don‚Äôt seem my speed anyways. I genuinely think this will be the best thing",0
"I took a benzo a little bit ago, so I‚Äôm not that freaked out right now, but today has been really, really hard. I don‚Äôt usually feel such utter despair, but it‚Äôs been creeping in and getting stronger by the day. I‚Äôm physically fine, and I can see a future that‚Äôs better than what I have now, but I don‚Äôt see it as worth living. Wage slavery at the bottom of the totem pole for another 30 years, no forms or loved ones outside my immediate family, no accomplishments or achievements. Just the long, slow decline into a sad, lonely old age, followed by a meaningless, protracted, lonely senescence. No one will care for me as an old man, because I‚Äôm incapable of caring for people now. I‚Äôm doomed to mediocrity and loneliness. Nothing can keep it from happening except ending it all before it gets to that point. I keep thinking ‚ÄòWell, I could try and off myself, that would keep things interesting and I could put off that fate for just a little longer.‚Äô But no. Eventually I‚Äôll settle down into a meaningless, soul sucking job, just like everyone else, and wait patiently for death like a good boy.",0

"A month ago I was feeling suicidal. During that period I had a conversation with my son's 16 year old cousin from his mom's side of the family. During our conversation he mentioned to me how much he cares and looks up to me and how I was the only adult he could talk to about girls, his problems, and guitars (shit all teenage boys like to talk about). After our conversation I started thinking about what he said and about all the people in my life that care/depend on me (my son, parents, friends, etc.). And for some reason it seemed like more of a reason to kill myself. I found comfort in knowing that if I killed myself I would be missed. I knew they would be sad for awhile but eventually they would move on and think about all the good times we had. I liked knowing that despite my decision I would die knowing I had an impact on someones life. Has anyone else felt that way? I've been to my psychiatrist and adjusted my meds and know I'm doing great. I just thought I'd share incase someone can relate.",0

"I'm posting here for the first time on my main reddit account. People I know will probably see this, they'll probably laugh, but I don't care anymore. I need to vent my feelings someplace. I'm a male, so the general stigma around depression for men is to just 'suck it up' like we don't have emotions. Things haven't been going well for me for a long time, and i'm constantly miserable. I feel as if nobody cares about me, and that life will never get better at all. I've never had anybody i'd consider a true friend really my entire life and now i'm 20, it's starting to really hurt. My social circle consists of two people, to which i'm sure they can't stand me. They're always making stupid jokes and putting me down, but - shit, they're the closest people I have to real friends, and the only people I talk to on a daily basis. I'm at rock bottom right now. Every single friendship I've ever tried to make has just turned people away from me, like i'm some monster. I don't even feel human anymore. I don't feel like I fit in anywhere. I need help. I need to fix myself, i'm a broken person. I don't even know what to do with myself anymore, honestly. I just wish someone would genuinely listen to me and care about my feelings and problems.",1
I have some pretty bad depression and I've been thinking about killing myself for a while but I have a 10 month old son and I want to be here for him but my wife hates me and makes me feel like the absolutely worst peice of shit ever and when she leaves me (because I know she will) I don't think I can handle not seeing my son. She is the only woman who would agree to marry me because I'm fat and gross and have no money and the only reason she has stayed is because she knows she can treat my like shit and I wont leave. I just want to be loved and have someone care about me but this marriage is circling the drain and I have no idea what to do. If you read all this I'm sorry you wasted your time I just really needed to vent some stuff.,1
"I... I can't imagine dying, it's not something that I want. And yet these thoughts they still exist and seem to scare and creep and haunt. Plenty of ways to go about it, some are easy, some are not. I let the feelings fill me up till I become too deep in thought. I'm standing on a bridge, I'm looking down at frigid water. I have come here with a thought, and intentions of self-slaughter. But when I stand up on the railing, I want someone to come, Someone to shout and pull me down, stop me from doing something dumb. I want a stranger's embrace, to reassure me it's okay. To tell me that it isn't worth it, that the trip's only one-way I want to bawl and breakdown, in the arms of the unknown. So I can maybe feel cared about, and not feel so alone... Now I'm in my room, with a note and rope in hand. Thinking I'll finally fall through, let my thoughts and mind disband. But when I step off of that stool, I want my mom to come rush down, To pull me out my quiet guillotine, and stop my silent drown. Oh, she'd probably hug and sob, knowing what I had tried to do. Glad she ran down stairs to check on me, as if had been on cue. That night would stay with her forever, make her always high alert, To stop her child from disappearing, or end up permanently hurt. However in both situations, I would simply end up dead. That is, if I could follow through with all these thoughts that haunt my head. Alas I am not suicidal, just a faking wannabee, Cause I don't actually want to die, I just want someone to save me...",1

Barely a few friends have stuck with me at this point. My crush has seen me at my desk when I'm going through a rough time but she just ignores me. She has talked to me frequently but it just seems that she doesn't care. One of my friends who I thought was my friend leaked out that I'm autistic and have ADHD as well as I take medications for that every day. Now, whenever I walk around school people look at me and laugh while talking shit about me. Some have called me a freak and leave the school and go to a mental asylum. I've been called a mistake so many times. All this has been affecting me emotionally and physically. This has been making my depression worse and has increased my levels of anxiety. I've been having more anxiety attacks since this all started. Everything around me is starting to become meaningless to me. Nothing other than my mom, my dog, and my little brother give me a genuine source of happiness. The people at my school have made me feel even more worthless than I was before this. I want to feel accepted by someone other than my family. (I consider my friends family as well) People who don't talk shit about me or don't look at me strangely just disregard I'm there.

"Preface, I'm a bit drunk rn, it helps numb this pain. A girl I knew and I had hooked up with in the past, then became friends with commit suicide recently. We weren't close but I'd consider her a special friend to me. We rarely saw each other, but when we did we had the best banter known to man. I'm doing great in school, have a girlfriend, got internships lined up and was happy before this. But now, since she commit suicide, the only thing that makes sense to me is to kill myself. I've had depressive episodes before but this feels different. Everytime my thoughts are blank or I zone out, my first thought is the fact she is actually gone. Last time I tried to commit suicide was 5 years ago, and even then it wasn't this impactful. &amp;#x200B; For some reason this girl's suicide has really fucked with me and makes me feel like suicide is a reasonable option. It makes me feel like I have a new purpose. I feel like there is something extraordinary waiting for me. I almost feel as if she is waiting for me. &amp;#x200B; I got home in a cab and cried the entire way. The cab driver said nothing. I said nothing. When he looked at me I felt he had accepted my fate as I had. Perhaps there is more, perhaps there isn't. But I do want to cry more, but I'm not close enough to the girl to deserve pity. &amp;#x200B; As I am typing this out I feel better. I feel as if I do not need to die right now but I do crave death. Just not at my hand. I accept being murdered, I accept an accident. &amp;#x200B; I just wish it was over.",0

What I would give for someone to say, ""I understand you're struggling, and I will understand if you choose to end it."" Even my friends who get suicidal ideation come from a perspective of it being something you'll get through. They talk about how meds have helped them. Or about how they've become more resilient. And they'll say they'll help and encourage you the whole way. But I don't want someone to encourage me. I want someone to sit with me and say, ""Yeah that really sucks."" To say, ""It's okay if you can't handle it."" Or even, ""I'll help you end the pain."" I wouldn't do anything, would never take them up on it. But it would be so incredibly validating. I want to be heard; I want to be understood. I'm on meds, I'm in therapy, I'm resilient. I know I'm doing all the right things.

The depression or whatever, doesn't ever go away, no matter if I change my work, have money or dont, with or without romantic partners, or how my social life is doing.

By this point I was crying and he just continued to make me feel like I was faking it or shouldn‚Äôt be there. It took me 6 years to speak up about this and now I‚Äôm regretting it because I always feared I would be told that I was overreacting or faking it. Was uncomfortable the whole time too because he was sitting with like less than a metre between us and. I have to go see him again in a few weeks and I‚Äôm so terrified, I‚Äôm still crying and it‚Äôs been 3 hours.

I have tried monitoring sleep but that has stopped and I am sleeping less. I tried a mood diary app on my phone but that last about a month. I also tried coming off facebook for a few weeks, but didn't notice much difference. I'm at a bit of a stand still with regards of what to do. I'm not too sure what to expect from writing this or if i'll get anything out of it. But i think the anonymity of it helps a little.",0
"This may be my final post on here, I dont know for sure. This won't harbor much attention I'm positive, since none of my prior posts have. Regardless, I've been feeling this way for awhile now, and I cant handle it much longer. I've tried to be strong, but I'm weakening everyday. My parents wont care, they'd be better off without me. I'm an average student but I'm never good enough. I love art but they dont understand. They want me to be a rich doctor. That wont happen. My only talent is art, and that's it - I know it wont get me anywhere. I do nothing but disgust and disappoint. I really wish I was aborted, never born. I'm a burden, and my parents refuse therapy because it costs money and all they care about is money and my grades. They as well dont believe in mental issues. I've always been too much of a pussy to consider hurting myself, let alone, ending myself. I know I wont have a future, so why bother with going onward? I'm banal, a dead weight. I've done nothing remarkable nor contributable. If I do kill myself my parents will blame it on 'the liberal school system brainwashing me' or some shit. I just want everything to go numb forever. I want to die, and I think it's going to happen sometime later today. Might go for an extra long walk or something, I dunno. They'll be happier, anyway.",0

"The last few I've seen were well-meaning but unfortunately it didn't work out. I feel worthless every day, I have no close friends, it really sucks. Countless social rejections have led me to believe that I am fundamentally broken, that no one wants to be my friend. I don't think that going to therapy will suddenly make me a really likable person that tons of people want to be friends with. But maybe it can make me feel better about myself. Because I can't go on living like this. I'm afraid I might try to kill myself or something.",1
Hello my name is Ahmet I am 24 since I have been 5 I was a target for rasicm in Turkey (I was the only Turk with Kurds) after years I have managed to save myself¬° but I couldn't get over it and my high-school and university was also a disaster.

I worked two years for getting a university at Japan (literally I saved my whole salary without even buying clothes to myself for being able to cover tuition fees) and now I got declined.¬ø¬ø Even better there is no next year for me. At then end of year I have to attend military service for a year and aspend every money I saved in the hell hole. If God has a son I am probably the one who killed him and this is the punishment,0

"I'm an 18 year old with severe depression, anxiety, ADHD, borderline personality disorder and DID at a point in my life. But I'm slowly recovering.

I'm mostly well-liked, but I know they think I'm a weirdo. Everyone does. It's final exam time for us, and I have to secure good marks, otherwise I won't be able to enter any good streams in a good college. It would be the end of my future. My family is in a financial crunch, but they give up everything for me. I am dead-set on helping my friends get through their depression and suicidal tendencies, but I'm failing at that. I have had three attempts, but I was saved by a person, who himself was alexithymic (I think) and suicidal. He still is, and he says if he doesn't do well, he will commit suicide. I don't know what I'm gonna do if I don't perform the way I should. But I certainly know that I will die if he does. In case everything goes wrong, I'll leave. There's no other way.

I want to tell my friends/family that I want to die, but I don't want to look like an attention seeker so I don't tell them.

I can't keep myself sober, and, frankly, I'm out of reasons to bother trying.

"(25M) I've been dealing with depression since I was about 14. I've been to countless therapists/doctors and have never had any relief. Throughout that time I've battled the urge to end my life and the only thing that seems to stop me is the guilt of hurting my family, in particular my mum. I feel like such an ungrateful piece of garbage for what I've put her though and I know she deserves better than me. She unfortunately isn't the only one. I recently ended it with my girlfriend because I couldn't stand what I was doing to her emotionally, the burden of having to deal with me day after day is exhausting and its simply not fair to ask that of her. I've had gfs in the past but she is the only one I've ever truly loved, I genuinely believe that she is/was the one, but I can't condemn her to a life with me. She simply deserves better. She's the most wonderful person I've ever known, and she should be with someone who can make her happy. I wish she hated me, so that she doesn't feel guilt or sadness when I die.

"Hi I'm going to be seeing a therapist for the first time in a while, at the urging of my partner. For a long time, I've felt like my problems did not warrant a therapy session, so I am just now taking my situation more seriously. I can't continue on like this and I know it. so I'm going. My problem is that I have minimal insurance (500$ for the year for mental health). My new therapist works on a sliding scale, but I don't know how much to pay. She's given me 100$ as an option, then I got overwhelmed and she told me to think about what I thought was fair. I might be able to get on my partner's insurance at some point, but I have no idea when, I'm now terrified of not being able to afford therapy, because I can feel myself getting close to a breaking point.

Nope, not allowed to make others pay, you're just supposed to up and move on from it. It's fucked. It's completely fucked.

"Today was not a good day. I‚Äôve been doing well for almost five months now and today was enough to put me back in a dark place. For those of you who monitor these posts to give advice, I‚Äôd really appreciate some right about now. I just don‚Äôt know how to control these urges anymore.

How do you feel better when you‚Äôve been beaten into submission again? What do you do? How do you distract yourself? How do you avoid these dark tendencies?

"I thought I escaped the depression. From the first dose of my Spiro and Estrogen I felt a huge weight off of my shoulders. It was time to be myself and thrive. I enjoyed it. I no longer needed to hide. After a couple of months I thought I'd try dating. Of course, I expected the hate messages. I expected the slurs. What I never expected was the amount of men that maintained interest after I disclosed that I'm transgender. What I soon found was a pattern. A pattern I could not escape. It was in this moment I realized what being a living fetish is like. For the past nine months I've been nothing more to men than a source for pictures and a discreet fun time. I still fall for the player saying he wants something more than hooking up just to be used, ghosted, and hit up when he is drunk and horny. The first few times hurt my ego but I recovered. Having the same story for nine months straight makes me question if this is all that life has for me. I want nothing more than to just connect with someone. Talk with a guy about life and get to know each other. But. The only attention I ever get are if I post naughty pics or nudes. Once I show and indication that I'm human they ghost. I've made a few trans friends and the story is the same. Doesn't matter how pretty. How much they pass. We're just a fetish and nothing more. It makes sense why they're all either depressed or escorts. I've fought the desire to end it completely so I no longer have to deal with the loneliness. It's a crippling loneliness.

"When my ego dies, will it take me with it? It's a selfish creature. It needs to be the best. It needs to be important. It needs people to agree with it. It throws tantrums.

It beats me down, demanding more than I could ever give. It piles on while I lie on the floor. It lives in a fantasy world full of delusion and self importance. But I withstand. I persist. It's all I know. It hurts. I suffer at its hands. I'm blinded. I was blinded. Now I see. Its time has passed. Once it goes, I can live without imagined fear. Once it's gone, I can truly live.

You have your back, and that‚Äôs what matters at the end of the day. Keeping this in mind, Take care of yourself and be proactive towards seeking friendships and human connections whenever possible.

Nothing makes me happy anymore. I‚Äôve had such a perfect life anyone else in my shoes would be so successful and happy then there‚Äôs me just rotting away in my bed for literally no god damn reason. I just want to fall asleep and never wake up.",0
"I have no one to talk to. I am 30 years old. I had a girlfrend. We were together for 8 years. We were talking about getting merried, move together. But last week she said she is leaving me. I am broken. Now I do not know how to move on. I realised that i do not have friends, have to live with my parents, have a job which I hate. Why should I live. When i wake up in the morning my first taught is to kill myself. I was thinkig abot killing myself before. But now i am serious about suicide. I will just go and buy a rope and hang myself. Who would miss me? Nobody. It would be better for everyone if i was death. I see a lot of people with perfect lives. Why i can not be like them. I do not know what to do.",0
"I used to be perfectly normal and then Physics hit me. I am constantly flunking tests and even when I‚Äôm relaxing or watching tv I either feel ok or literally want to vanish and hang my self. I get a lot of mood swings going from neutral, happy, sad with neutral and super sad everyday. I always hold a happy face literally acting ok and happy and I can‚Äôt take it. No one really cares about me anyway and it feels unbearable or I‚Äôm quite happy. It‚Äôs been 2 years of this and I‚Äôm seriously might end it but subconsciously I feel like if I tell someone it is making me seem like a wimp for not being able to do it and dishonours real depressed people. But the only thing that keeps me going is setting goals like I want to be a programmer or play video games or my brother.",0
I‚Äôve bought this all on myself. I have a porn and sex addiction that has lead me to chest on my girlfriend. We have decided to try and make it work but I can‚Äôt stop the thoughts of regret and hatred to myself. I feel like the only thing that would help me and my girlfriend move on would be me out if the situation. I don‚Äôt think I could physically go through with it but the thoughts are always there. Not really looking for advice but happy to hear anything anyone has to say it‚Äôs just been a help writing this down,0
"I can‚Äôt anymore, I‚Äôve tried for about 5 year now. All I got was kicks and punches from life. I fail daily tasks and cannot control myself. I hurt my surrounding and hate myself the most. I am suffering so much, yet I can‚Äôt bring myself over to pull the trigger or cut with the knife. I‚Äôve been going to therapy for a while but there‚Äôs nothing changed, no help either. I‚Äôm thinking about taking an overdose of meds, but I don‚Äôt know if it will work. If not I cannot live with the afterwards consequences I have to face. I cannot bear to live another single day either. I am just so done. If anyone I know sees this, thanks for nothing. Thanks for thinking you‚Äôre trying, yet you just secretly watched me slowly dying. I hope humanity gets eradicated within the next decades.",0
"I feel sick whenever someone praises me, or says anything optimistic directed towards me. It feels disgusting, as if they're lying to my face. My mind tells me they have to be lying. They *have* to, else everything I've established in my head about myself is destroyed. Can anyone relate?",0
"I always liked beauty. Probably the only thing that kept me from ending it all. But even it wasn't enough, isn't, most of the time. Sometimes the only thing that calms me is to plan how I'm going to do it. It came to a point that every time that I'm suicidal again the only thing stopping me is the complexity of the scene. I still don't have the right things, I can't go to the place, my hair isn't in the right length and etc. I never told anyone about it. I'm living between numbness and intense feelings that hurt too much. I feel like I'm wasting my privileges, I'm wasting my capacities, I don't want to, I don't know what to do. The best phases are when I'm hyper, but I get destructive and it's not ideal. I miss xanax but I'm tired of numbing it down. I'm tired of living like a nun, I'm tired of always having to control myself so much when I feel something. And I ask myself what is going to happen the day I have everything ready. Sometimes I wish it was today. Sometimes I just don't want to think about it. If someone knows a way out of this, I can listen. I'm always listening anyway.",0
When I‚Äôm asleep I can‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm drowning like I constantly feel I am. I feel so empty and lost on a daily basis and just hide behind a fake smile. I don‚Äôt have the drive anymore. I feel so alone in this world. Don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to or anything.. I‚Äôve asked my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù if they wanted to go to six flags cause I have a season pass and can get people in super cheap Or free and they all just dust me off. It‚Äôs sucks.,0
Like I am in so much pain but I can‚Äôt seem to cry I just sit feeling so fucking numb and I just don‚Äôt know how to feel anything. I have many reasons To live but selfishly I do not care. I w a n t to d I e,0
From the time i remember myself i would always think im stupid and ugly and everybody else is better. From the time i was 14-15 i would imagine how to end it all. Why is my life like this I've never done anything wrong to anyone. If reincarnation is a real thing I was a selfish person that wanted the world now im stuck.,1
"My life is probably the worst it‚Äôs been in awhile. My parents basically tortured me as a child and now it‚Äôs gotten to the point I don‚Äôt talk to anyone. Not once. I used to be somewhat popular and have a lot of friends. Now since I‚Äôve been here having suicidal thoughts and attempts, I pushed everyone away making me feel even worse it just feeds it self and I feel like the only out is death. Does anyone else feel this way?",0
"I used to fear death and have hypochondria. I guess I loved life so much that the prospect of losing it all was terrifying. But now my life is so dull that I probably wouldn't lose as much if I died. I still fear death and the darkness of it all, but the fear has taken a backseat. Is this a slippery slope towards suicidal thoughts? I'm not suicidal and couldn't imagine myself being suicidal.",0
"Nobody actually likes me, not a single person I know values me and has interest in me as a friend or a best friend , I just suck and I'm so easily replaced, I don't want to live anymore feeling this empty",1
"I really don‚Äôt have any evidence on this, but I have this feeling my GF cheated (or still is) on me. I have told her about this and we try different things to strengthen the trust again but nothing really works. This is ruining our relationship that was going great until this. It all started with me thinking that my friend and her were very friendly with each other, plus they shared a lot in common. That idea grew in my head at one point I had convinced myself it was true. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs true or not I confronted both of them, but of course they denied it. Doesn‚Äôt help that my friend is always lying about things (small things at times) and after telling him the situation he hated me and began acting like a dick and showed me a side of him I never knew. I understand people will do and say things that they don‚Äôt mean when mad but he said some mean things lol. We ended up talking things out after I almost fought him because of the slimy shit he did. At the time I thought it was real but now I think it was to avoid the fight.",0
"I'm not happy, I feel alone while completely surrounded by people who love me. I read everything my boyfriend texts me the wrong way and feel as if he's constantly angry at me so i uust avoid telling him how i feel. I feel like a failure in my job, a failure with money a failure in general. My therapy got cancelled because I missed two sessions (one because my appendix burst and the other because i had a breakdown and couldn't leave the house). I feel stagnant and unloved and stupid for thinking this way because theres no reason to why I should think like this. Im at a loss. I need someone to talk to, I can't outright ask for attention from anyone because then I'll be needy. I just have to keep plodding on but I cant plod on. I am trying and it is hurting me. I wish i wasnt around anymore, I really do. Im sorry reddit, I just needed somewhere to vent. I don't want to be a bother. But any advice in terms of just getting eyour emotions to level out would be fab. If you've made it this far, I'm sorry for taking time out of your day for just moaning.",0
"Today‚Äôs my birthday and in the single hour I‚Äôve been awake, it‚Äôs already been one of the shittiest days I‚Äôve had these past few months. I‚Äôm fucking sick of being here and I just don‚Äôt want to be here anymore god damnit. I just don‚Äôt want to be doing this shit. I have a girlfriend who genuinely seems to care (no obligation to me or feels stuck with me) and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be here without her. I‚Äôm here... but to what benefit?",0
"you know how people always say ""you're lonely, not alone""? i really honestly feel like i'm just unable to become close to another human being - mutually. i have a lot of people in my life who love me and want to be close to me. but i feel cold saying that i am either too overwhelmed by them or i don't feel close to them. i cant bond with others anymore. i used to have stupid useless sex constantly that made me feel like a piece of meat to be consumed. now intimacy terrifies me. closeness and hugs scare me. i'm extremely isolated and i only ever leave the house for my (extremely tough medical) school and to get food. debt is piling up because of that but its my only joy. i cant stand people getting close to me. i cant stand hanging out with friends. but yet i want love and intimacy so badly. i feel like im so broken, and that i'm never going to feel like a human again. i just feel like a vessel that serves as a stupid, servicing fleshlight to fuck. to only ever improve the quality of others - not me. i don't deserve it. i just don't understand why i shouldn't just kill myself over spring break. that way if i survive, i have a week to be in the psych hospital and not miss any assignments or exams.",1
"I make fun of my friend for being skinny and punch her around. I jab at my other friend everytime she makes a little mistake. I'm an asshole. I just make fun of people out of instinct, and complain when people do the same to me. I'm a toxic ass hypocrite. yet I complain, sit on my ass, and don't change. ironic.",1
"If I made a list of the people I love it would be no one. If I made a list of my favorite songs it would be none. If I made a list of everything that I want to become and want to accomplish.. there would be no answer. All I feel is anxiety, fear, and pain. Eating makes me feel sick. I cant get more than a couple hours of sleep. I'm just ready to go and I dont care how it affects anyone.",0
"I have dysthymia and have dealt with suicidal ideation privately for years, but over the past 6 months and especially over the last 48 hours it has gotten really really bad. I feel like I am two people right now. One version is ready to go and has a solid plan for how to do it. The other version is horrified and sick at this. I am preventing myself from acting by reminding myself of how much I'm needed at work tomorrow, by thinking of how dependent my pet cat is on me, by imagining how much this will hurt my friends. The two sides are battling it out. I don't think I'll act on my suicidal thoughts tonight, but I may within the next few days. I don't know what to do. I'm broke and can't handle an ER bill. I definitely can't go to family with this and I'm afraid to go to friends. I have a therapist but won't see her until Sunday. I don't know what to do but I know I have to do something. Please suggest something",0
"I've already had a lot going on in my personal life, and I was closer to suicide than I'd ever been. Then there was a huge argument among my friends. I won't get into details, but I don't think they'll make up. I was right in the middle and now I need to fucking pick a side. But I don't want to pick a side. If I do I'll lose some of my friends, and I am neutral on the whole situation anyway. If I don't pick a side, I'll start spending more time with one group than the other because I hate changing things, and then they'll hate me. So I'm going to isolate. I won't sit with them in the morning or at lunch, I'll only work with them in class if they come to me, etc. If they want to talk to me they'll find me. I don't have any other friends, so I'll be completely alone. Of course, that'll only happen if I don't end up killing myself before the end of March break. I was so close to suicide before the argument, but now I'm pushed past my limit. I'll probably go for the next opportunity I get (i.e. know I'll be home alone for 2+ hours). I just can't take this anymore, it's all become too much. I don't really want to die, but nothing ever gets better so what's the point. I just give up.",0
I told my parents I loved them and that I was sorry. I told them its not their fault Im just tired of waking up and feeling like I‚Äôm in fight or flight every day all day. I told my girlfriend she should move on and find someone better who actually deserves her love. I told my friends thank you for being there sometimes but Im done fighting. I‚Äôve lost the battle. Tomorrow is my last sunrise. Tomorrow night I‚Äôm out of here. Good bye all.,0
"Hey, I created an account because I honestly dont know what I am doing anymore on here. Last year was the worst of my life. My long time GF (4 years) and I broke up. She lives in a different state so I flew there to speak to her and atleast end it on good terms. The day after I started a new job. It started well with my manager happy but the next week I had another manager who joined (the person who hired me was sacked). Towards the end of the first month, I ended up having surgery on my back. This is where the issues started, The surgery and the breakup really affected me physically and mentally and I kept making errors which were easily avoidable. Eventually it got too much for them and they released me. It took me 3 years to find the job in my field which I graduated in and i honestly thought it was what I was looking for. Unfortunately, I got left with no job and now no partner. I have a job now - in my field but not exactly the same (if that makes sense) but it is really going nowhere. My manager is good and is happy with my performance but the organisation does not allow for any growth. The person who I replaced is younger than me and is already far ahead in their career than I will. To top it all off, I live in a small town and it will be hard to hide the termination. I honestly dont know what is the point anymore. No matter what I do, it feels it is never enough and I am not going anywhere",0
"I was at Sagres ‚Äîthe end of the world‚Äî today, and all I really wanted to do was jump of the cliff into the water. I was told it‚Äôs an instant death. If I had been there alone, I probably would‚Äôve jumped.",0
i feel like no matter how hard i try when i make one step forward i‚Äôm always two steps back. it‚Äôs so defeating and embarrassing,0
Here i am in bed holding a knife its been like an hour that im trying to get to courage just to stab myself in the carotid artery already wrote a suicide note and everything but im such a coward i just cant do it fuck fuck fuck i dont wanna live in this nightmare anymore i dont wanna wake for tomorrow everyday day is the same shitty day,0
All my friends live out of town. I had to go no contact with my mom again. Usually the only person i speak to on the day to day is my 8 yr old. Im 29 and don't know how to make friends. Occasionally someone moe extroverted will make friends with me but it always ends with them taking advantage of my kindness so i have to drop them from my life. Im tired of being alone. Im tired of being disabled. Im tired of all my mental illnesses. Im tired of wanting to die. I need to be held so bad. A judge once told my mom she shouldn't have had kids. He was right. I didn't ask for this. Im in therapy and on antidepressants but its not enough. I just want it to be over.,0
I‚Äôm 26. I feel swallowed in regret &amp; Shame. It keeps nagging me to reconnect with old friends &amp; associates. I haven‚Äôt spoke to them in over a decade. I genuinely care about their well being but for some reason it‚Äôll feel fake of me. I can‚Äôt enjoy the present with my family &amp; friends. I get bored or lose interest &amp; will feel sad out of nowhere. Anybody been through this? Or know how to move forward?,0
"I want to talk to someone, anyone, with a desperate fervour. The subject doesn't matter, as long as the person is interested in talking to me. I honestly can't remember a time when I *didn't* feel so alone, but lately it seems to have gotten even worse. Even people whom I once thought my friends seem to have lost any interest in me. I want to talk to *someone.* But I also can't tell anyone about this, because I worry that they will only speak to me out of pity or a misguided sympathy. I do not want either of those, I can not stand the mere thought of them. All I want, is to be genuinely liked. But I feel like I don't *have* anything to be liked for: I'm not funny, I'm not smart, I'm not charming, I can't even listen to people that well. Who would ever *want* to befriend me?",1
"I know it's really dumb to keep spamming and spamming, I've already made two other posts here. Unless it was actually three and I have the memory of a goldfish. I just feel alone as hell and I need to vent. Again. I'm pissed at myself for eating today. The plan was not to eat anything this month but I fucked that up. Hopefully, starting tomorrow, I'll be able to control my fatass self and not eat until April. And I started cutting again today so that's great. But I'm actually so fucking pathetic that I can't even cut that deep because it hurts too much. I cut my neck which is just dumb as hell since the neck is difficult to cover. The sad part is that a small part of me wants people to see. That's super fucked up, why would I want that? I have an appointment with a psychiatrist tomorrow. Hopefully he can give me meds that actually work. That is my last hope. Otherwise suicide is my only option, if I just have the guts to go through with it. I don't know why I keep ranting but thanks for reading.",1
"I just need some interaction, I‚Äôm trying really hard not to cut myself right now. I‚Äôm addicted and it‚Äôs a problem. My day was shitty, but I‚Äôd like to hear about yours.",0
"I've been feeling incredibly lonely recently. My psychiatrist can't see me until next Friday (she isn't covered under my insurance). TL;DR Tell me some kindness you've witnessed or received. I have been unemployed since December and I was holding on until I got my tax refund so I could see my psychiatrist for new meds, fixing my car, anything until I can get another job. Then the government took it all for student loans. I used all my energy and grit to get here, only to be still stranded and lower than ever. I don't talk to my friends anymore about it because they just think being strong is the key and that I will be fine. I don't feel fine. I used everything up and now I am here, jobless, broke, and not even caring to take care of myself anymore. What's the point, you know? I would like to hear some kindnesses you've witnessed. I've given up thinking anything good will happen to me (after three years of being kicked in the teeth every three weeks) but I want to hear how the world is still a good place.",0
"oki so idrk why I'm doing this, ig maybe I'm just wallowing in self pity, but I rlly dont see why I should be alive anymore. my gf broke up with me, I no longer talk to my best friend, and I have good friends, i just feel so lonely all the time, like I'm drowning, and i feel like everyone is leaving me one by one and maybe it would help if i just died now because at least there would be someone who cared. what can I do?",1

They both have boyfriends and even on the photos they posted of the 3 of us together some guys said that they were both hot, but conveniently left me out of that. I have anorexia and my mom took some pics of us all hanging out. Today she said ""look at those pictures. you look like a 12 year old with two babysitters. they're beautiful and look at you. i don't care if you have to deal with your sad thoughts and shit that sucks but you're an embarrassment to me and antisocial your friends seem to have more fun with each other than with you, you're antisocial i wouldn't wanna be your friend.""

I‚Äôve been crying nonstop since he broke up and i can‚Äôt eat anything because o hate my body and i‚Äôve been so nauseous since he broke up. Everything reminds me of him and it hurts so much. It‚Äôs not only about him tho, everything sucks, i cannot get a job and i am a disappointment to everyone in my life. I really can‚Äôt do it anymore. I don‚Äôt even have my meds anymore even though i doubt they would help. I am really thinking about overdosing again but idk if it would work because the other times i tried it didn‚Äôt work either. I just hate my life so much and no it doesn‚Äôt t better eventually, i‚Äôve been telling myself that forever but whenever it gets a bit better, it gets a lot worse immediately after. I just can‚Äôt do it anymore Edit: this is a throwaway account so the people i know on here don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs me Edit 2: i just realised my life literally has no meaning anymore, i have no goals, i am unhappy, i have nothing i enjoy and i just wanna die, i am literally just staying alive for other people",1
"I was doing so good, the birds all sang in the morning, the aroma of the flowers; I had not been enticed by that smell in such a long time. I had managed to clean my room; got rid of the giant stack of clothes, the water bottle collection and opened up the curtains to let the sun radiate my small lumpy mattress. Lost 5 pounds in 2 weeks from eating right and hitting the gym. Went out of my way to interact with people, like I used to love. I was planning to make a cheesecake with my niece and make strawberry flowers. Then I realized how pointless all THIS is. I‚Äôm NEVER going to be happy. I guess that‚Äôs just how it goes. Like a swing, bro.

My parents are disappointed and angry at me. Today i skipped an exam because i just can't drag myself to the campus just to at least show up. It felt so horrible and i can't stand it. So i took any meds i have and start swallowing them. All this time i've been cutting but all i can manage is just shallow cuts and then bleed for a few minutes, so today i want to try a new method. I don't know if 15 pills enough but that's all i have on me.

"And this time I cant really hide it. The last few times its happened I‚Äôve been able to hide it from my friends beaches I only had two clase with them, but this year I have four. They‚Äôve never really seen me slip into a depression before (in fact they didn‚Äôt notice the first time when it was really, really bad) so they‚Äôve come to the conclusion that I‚Äôve started cutting again. They‚Äôre not exactly wrong, but its not even ounce every two weeks, and not for the reasons they think (bullying/ people being less than kind). They really don‚Äôt know as much about my mental state as they think they do. Should I do something? Is there anything I can do without freaking them out with my suicidal tendencies?",0

Needless to say I did something wrong. I‚Äôll explain, I was enjoying some YouTube when I saw ‚ÄúBeautiful?‚Äù by illymations. It was a very triggering song for me and I sniped my skin after a year long clean streak ( if you‚Äôre confused because I‚Äôve been gone for four months I didn‚Äôt cut in that time) and gained a handy dandy addiction. I used anything I could get my hands on, then one day my dog was biting me really hard and I went on the floor crying thinking about how everyone hates me even my dog. Then I really wanted to die every day. I have the same schedule every day, wake up and snooze till I make my lunch, I never eat breakfast, switch t-shirts, bike to school and say hi to the crossing guard, go to each class feeling like garbage and cutting in pe and English, biking home feeling like a failure, eating and being apathetic, doing my homework till I pass out (so like two pages in) waking up and doing more homework then going to bed at 2 then waking up and doing it all again. I became really shady going to target for razor blades at 8 pm and wearing hoodies everywhere. Now I feel bad for writing this",1

I'm starting to think I don't have depression and I'm just a bitch and I don't know how to tell if that's the case. The weirdest thing is, over the last month I've been increasingly feeling well. My life is shit becausd I missed lits of school and so I worry a lot, but that's normal. Other than that I feel.. fine. I don't feel depressed.

I went to theropy for a bit but found it far more stressful than useful, so I turned to self help books. I started to think more positively, have a bit, more confidence in my self, and felt like I genuinely self improved. That countied until a few days ago. I got rejected by someone I really cared about, and it didn't go well. After farther reflection, I haven't made progress on any of the goals I set to fix myself, even though I put in all my effort. My little confidence I gained is shattered. For the last few days, I have though about sueicde a lot, to the point where I don't go into work anymore because there is no point. That friend I had has moved up in life, to the point where I feel if I reach out to him I will just be a burden anyways. I am not close to my family at all, and if they knew I was depressed they would tell me to suck it up. I don't believe in religion, it's likely we live in a computer simulation so nothing will matter if I go. I am going to die alone, so why wait for it to happen naturally?",0
"Hi. I have had a bit of a rough day and honestly it feels like my thoughts are actually killing me. So I really feel like I need to express my feelings right now. So my thoughts are just gonna be thrown out there so without further ado.... I think I suck. At everything...my job, having friends, just...everything really. It honestly feels like I cannot just work like a human being. Now don't get me wrong, i don't hate life. I have things I rather love about life such as my family and my job including the people I work with. And everyone keeps telling me how ""nice"" and ""good"" I am at my job such as winning a rather ""employee of the month"" sorta thing but as strange as this seems.... I struggle to believe them. Now of course I'm not calling them liars I just find it to hard to believe. I know that sounds rather stupid but I honestly just can't help feel this way. As I said I truly love my job and everyone there but that is honestly where most of my self esteem comes from so constantly thinking I'm horrible at it is obviously not a good cycle. Now as for everything else apart from my job, well I will just break it down like this: I'm at overweight, ugly, shy, embarssing and awkward guy that honestly anyone could cringe at talking to. And of course I'm trying to overcome some of these things like the overweight part but...I'm honestly losing hope at this point and it's giving thoughts of doing something silly to my self. Sorry about this silly dump of self pity but I actually couldn't think of what else to do. Thanks for reading and have a good rest day.",0
"i‚Äôm just so tired. it feels like the only rational decision at this point. im never ever going to feel relief. i‚Äôm stupid, i‚Äôm unreliable, i‚Äôm trapped. i feel so trapped all the time. life is just a cage. i want to sleep. i think i‚Äôll finish up writing notes and go to bed. hell, if everyone‚Äôs asleep by then i‚Äôll just pour myself a cup of bleach and i‚Äôll be dead in the morning. i just hope everything‚Äôs over soon",0
"Previously I posted in r/Assistance that I got out of debt reselling stuff... Everything was going very well until I wanted to make an order for things I already got paid for. Accidentally deposited to a phishing site that looked and acted exactly like the original one. Now instead of being 2000 USD in debt, I'm in 12000 USD debt. And yesterday was my first suicide attempt... It would be successfull if my dad didn't come early from work. Five more minutes and I'd be dead. I don't know if it's good I didn't die.",0
"hey there everybody, you know when you can't get out of bed for days at a time, well what's your favourite thing to do while stuck in bed? i like to sleep. it's weird but when i'm depressed i don't listen to music much. except music that makes me feel nostalgic, occasionally. normally when my depression shifts into a more passive state i listen to lots of music. lots of youtube but that's not terribly stimulating though",0
"I‚Äôm in kind of a hole. Almost 4 months of no work now. All i do is get high. I don‚Äôt go out with friends anymore. I don‚Äôt leave the house anymore, only to buy weed. I‚Äôve gotten kind of anxious of people. And very very bitter in general. Does anyone relate? Do you have any tips of how to get out of this? I‚Äôm in therapy. And i promise myself every night that tomorrow will be different, but that usually only lasts like a day or two and then I go back into bed.",0
It used to be something I did once every couple weeks at a party when I was a teen. Now it makes me happy. I love waking up still hungover with brain fog. It gives me this fuzzy feeling I used to feel with my SO. I know it‚Äôs terrible for me. I still work out but that only gives me an hour high. I‚Äôve realized if I‚Äôm sober my thoughts consume me and when I‚Äôm drunk everything‚Äôs ok. My family and friends wonder how I do it but I guess I like the depressing hungover feeling.,0
"Is it bad that I kind of want to just catch the virus already? I have a lot of health conditions and if I die from the virus, oh well it was tragic. Just get it over with. My odds of getting it are pretty high anyway, seeing that I live in the epicenter of the US outbreak and have to go out in public for work. I‚Äôm already a burden to everyone around me. I‚Äôm an inconvenience and my pain is over dramatic. I don‚Äôt have the right to complain and don‚Äôt want to annoy those around me by saying anything or accidentally letting on that something is up. The way I feel is disproportionate to the severity of my problems and I should be over it. Dying by COVID-19 would solve that, honestly. I don‚Äôt really want to die, especially not from suffocation and pneumonia, but it feels inevitable right now. Sorry for the rant. If you read to the end, have a good night and wash your hands. Maybe it‚Äôll end this thing sooner.",0
"The reason I drink is to self medicate because I saw my friend pass away in a car accident when I was 19. We were both stupid and I challenged him to a race using our parents cars. Basically, he understeered into a tree. I have tried therapy but it didn't work for me. I was also diagnosed with PTSD and depression. I stopped taking my prescription because it didn't work for me. I feel that I have blood on my hands because I was the one who made him do it. My parents and grandfather came to me and told me that they were worried about my drinking problem. I sometimes drink a bottle of Vodka a day. I just want to drink myself to death because I'm too scared of killing myself. My granddad tried to relate to the situation by telling me about the things he was in Vietnam. I walked out because I was upset about everything. I now think that I was out of order and I would do anything to apologise. But at the same time, I feel that they shouldn't have bought my grandfather along because he is getting Parkinsons disease so I don't want him to worry about me as well.",0
"hi. I'm not sure if this is one of those things where if you have to ask it then there is a definite answer, but I'm not sure if what I experience is truly suicidal thoughts. when I don't feel sad I become very thankful and when I try to express to God thanks for what he has given me, I feel guilty for spending my time self harming or being self destructive. I feel I'll never be able to truly convey how thankful I am for what he's given me and I'm back to square one, just wishing I was never born so I wouldn't have these thoughts and emotions. I don't really care about anything and many of my thoughts are just wishing I could disappear or wishing I was ""less"" in every possible way. I want to not be alive so I don't feel the emotions I feel. I do not often contemplate different ways to kill myself, it is moreso just wishing I wasn't born in the first place or hoping someday something else will happen to me that makes this decision for me. the majority of my thoughts are wishing I was dead or never born, and even when I'm happy I just wish I could stop feeling and the answer to that to me is death. is the way I'm feeling considered suicidal? thank you for reading. any comment will be appreciated and answered.",0
"Another thing. My mom recommended I consider a grief therapy group or just a normal therapy group. I don't think I'm still grieving but I might be. I was in a process group many times, but I only sometimes felt okay with it. Some of the others had an idea of what I deal with, as far as crippling depression and at the time, a bad home life. But they didn't have DID or BPD. At this point it's either one ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. And the therapists, it didn't seem like they really knew how to help, like maybe they have had a personality case before but not on my level. I'm actually considering getting back into a group. Who knows, maybe this time they can actually help. I'm trying to not be so closed off. That's how it gets worse. Start shifting personalities and when I interact with my mom or anyone calling me, it's me but not me. Hope that makes sense. Hope you guys are having a comfortable day, sending good vibes your way.",0
"Hi, First post on this sub in a while but I'm at a loss of what to do I'm so fed up of feeling numb and tired and like I don't want to exist and my brain is so fogged that I cant think straight I'm trying everything - taking the pills, doing the therapy, seeking advice and just nothing seems to be helping I don't like my job, but I also don't want to resign without anything else lined up and all of the experts and forums and advice systems just suggest trying to 'think in a more positive manner' and I'm really trying but it just feels hopeless, I get 5 minutes of 'maybe this will be OK!' then immediately back to the grey reality I've started applying for new jobs as my current manager has suggested that we get through year end then if I'm still feeling the same way then perhaps I should look elsewhere so I kind of don't see the point in actually trying until year end as if I'm not staying then who am I impressing? I have a 1:1 later so I guess I'll find out if it's time to leave &amp;#x200B; has anyone had this ? can anyone help? sorry just a brain dump cheers",0
"The reasons why: - Severe depression. No cure and never getting better. - 30 year old virgin. Still don't know how to make friends or talk to girls. - Not able to focus myself and get into the field I want...so stuck at crappy jobs. - About to be fired from crappy job #9 for being late too much. (Late almost every day cause I can't sleep nd can't get myself out of bed in the morning) - Massive debt due to school loans, car repairs, and me being stupid. - Bank account at $-111. Could have afforded the make the account positive today if the bank would waive the fees one more day. But they won't so I can't. Basically I can't manage time, money, sleep, or a social life. So I'm calling it here...game over. I get paid Friday. Going to buy a gun. Gonna make sure my cat has plenty of food and water, and someone to take her when I'm gone. Treat myself to whatever I want for the best last meal i can afford. Going to get drunk as hell. And end it all. The End. Fade to black. No more pain.",0
"When I was in the 10th grade I started to lose my memory and developed painful symptoms in my limbs, I immediately knew it was extremely serious and possibly terminal. Every few months I would get more sick and it has remained that way for the past 6 years I have been getting worse every few months. My disease has become so severe that I cannot continue school or study from cognitive impairment, I can barely eat anything without getting pain and it is impossible to gain any weight.I can barely walk outside because of shortness of breath, I cannot leave the house in the summer.the disease is extremely painful and disabling every day is a battle with pain, and controlling symptoms. several doctors have diagnosed me with a neurological disease which they say is untreatable and not curable. so for the past few weeks I have been visiting gun shops while I lie to my parents and tell them I am going to the gym. everyone treats me like crap especially my parents. my body has reached its physical limits, I cannot endure any more pain from the disease it is impossible, so I am going to buy guns and kill myself.",0
Most days I feel like I want to kill my self. I find it so hard to carry on sometimes. I spoke to the well being people yesterday but it wasn't any help and it 3 months waiting to talk to some one over the phone,0
"Yesterday I attempted suicide but stopped midway through (you could say chickened out?). Anyhow, I felt really drowsy immedietely after and went to sleep. Woke up this morning with terrible headache, nausea and cold sweats. I've thrown up twice in the past couple of hours. Had to miss class because of this and honestly I'm really worried about failing. I can't eat anything without throwing up. So I am just lying in bed munching on gummies because that's all I can stomach right now.",0
"I just felt like jumping from a high rise building, I almost went near the edge but I don't know what made me back out. I have been on anti depressants since 2 years and was coping well. But since my mom passed away last month at the age of 50 I am not who I am. I am just not finding any meaning in life. Right now I am feeling numb and my heart is pounding. It feels terrible.",0
I mean I'm going to live in my parents basement until I die so what does it matter if I'm gay or straight. Not like I'll actually do anything about it.,0
"No matter how much I struggle, I always end up feeling awful and get off track from pursuing my goals. I want to study physics, but in my country there's literally only one decent uni where I can study physics and have a chance of going abroad for masters and a phd. I'm kinda confident in my intelligence so I think I have a good chance of getting in, but not like this. Thinking feels tiring for me, so I tend to spend most of my life in a dissociative fugue state, if that makes sense? I feel anxiety when I force myself to think analytically. I also feel like I can't ask for help from anyone around me. I'm mostly a stoic person who's infamous for showing no outward emotion, so people mostly get amused when I'm upset, which enrages me. Sorry if this makes no sense, English is a secondary language for me and I have trouble expressing myself with words.",0
"Title says it all, i did a full upper body workout to cope with the thoughts in my head. Blasting twenty one pilots ü§ò Today was a pretty shit day, i had bad hair the entire day which was shit. And i got home and the voices returned and kept telling me i was piece of shit. Ive got one question, how do you learn to love yourself?",1
"Hi all, I'm 22 years old and are working as software engineer.. On the last 3 days, I just got emotionally triggerred just by reading a manga that potrays loneliness and pedophilic romantic relationships.. I know it sounds so exaggereative and/or trashy, but I didnt expect that manga would push my buttons deep inside, so hard that I would just weep uncontrollably and are having suicidal thoughts due to the tragic content of the manga.. Was I emotionally triggered because of it resonates deep within my subconscious? Or is it just because I long such relationship potrayed in it as a pedophile? Or both? The last 3 days I wasnt able to function properly at work.. Any idea to shake it off my head?",0
"1 year ago, I left for good. I was a reddit lurker for a while but never made an account. The day I left, I felt so free, yet I was the loneliest I‚Äôve ever felt . I was completely lost and confused. I made a reddit account this day a year ago and found comfort in this platform. I am not the same person I was a year ago and it has been so hard piecing myself together. I‚Äôve learned many things along the way. I am still growing and working on myself. I still have a long way to go but I feel way better than I did a year ago. Happy cake day.",0
I get some traction every so little to give me a false sense of hope and it comes crashing down. I feel like a pussy for not just ending it right now. Fuck this negative shit. I just want to have a life of fucking happiness but NO! I get to have depression for six years and hope to some god it gets better.,0
I was brutally raped for 2 months. By my best friends boyfriend. My best friend died of cancer. A month later her boyfriend messaged me saying he just needed a friend. I went over that night to his place. I regret ever doing that. He drugged and raped me. The next morning he threatened me. Told me if I didn‚Äôt keep giving him what he wanted he would kill me and himself. I was terrified. For 2 months every day I let him bias and rape me. Out of fear. I eventually started to get myself so drunk I‚Äôd just pass out. I‚Äôd wake up bloody and bruised. He‚Äôd wake up ready to do it all over again. I‚Äôm now so fucked in the head from this experience I find myself missing him. I hate these thoughts. They never go away. I don‚Äôt want to think this way anymore. I‚Äôve tried everything. Nothing works. I want to die so I can never feel this way again. It‚Äôs been years of feeling this way. The void is calling my name.,0
"I was bullied through out my school years, especially in high school. At the time I thought it was the darkest part of my life. I'm in my early 30s and now that I consider those times ""the good ol' days"" it really goes to show how low I've sank.",0
"My depression has been at its worst recently and I‚Äôve been trying desperately to find a therapist. The people I usually go through have told me it‚Äôs a 9 month waiting list and I honestly don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to wait that long so they suggested someone else. I checked their website and applied for therapy and managed to book an assessment appointment for next month. I slept easier last night at the thought that I‚Äôd be getting help soon only to wake up this morning to a notification on my phone saying they had cancelled my appointment as they no longer help people in my area. I‚Äôm just so sick of trying to help myself. I know it‚Äôs not their fault for not being able to help me, but just that brief feeling of hope meant so much to me. They shouldn‚Äôt allow people to apply if they aren‚Äôt going to be able to help or at least have a warning up. Everywhere I‚Äôve looked so far has said to either wait, go to A&amp;E or call 111 IF it‚Äôs an emergency. What classifies as an emergency? Because I‚Äôm almost certain I wouldn‚Äôt be considered one and I don‚Äôt want to waste their time considering the NHS is already stretched thin. I‚Äôd pay for a therapist if I had the means but I can barely afford to feed myself right now. I just don‚Äôt know what to do from here but I don‚Äôt want to give up.",0
"Going bowling with some friends from school this weekend, and I‚Äôm looking forward to it but also scared of ruining the night. I wanna be myself, but at the same time, I don‚Äôt wanna come off as depressing to everyone, I have to put on a happy face, and act like everything is okay. And it really sucks you know? I wish I could be vocal about my life and not be given blank looks from everyone and turn the mood sour with my negativity. Any tips on how maybe I can have a good time. I‚Äôve considered just taking some Adderall and that‚Äôll solve my problems but idk.",0
Well I think about doing it but I can't even commit to doing just because of the pressure of being the only male to carry the family name,0
I hate being around my family I get uneasy and start to get irritated. Both my dad and mom were alcoholics and physically and emotionally abusive in the past. Now I don‚Äôt even talk to them and when I do it‚Äôs in a robotic tone. I don‚Äôt hate my parents and I do sometimes feel bad for not being close to them but I can‚Äôt ignore how I feel. I don‚Äôt enjoy their company but I want the best for them. And before you judge me and call me a selfish son I wanna let you know that I‚Äôve been beat with wires and fist my feet hands and mouth were once taped while I was beat. The bias stopped when I started fighting back. They are also very controlling my mom is always on my back always hovering over me and I‚Äôm kinda annoyed by her she treats me like a little boy and like I can‚Äôt do nothing for myself. They limit me and I don‚Äôt wanna be around them.,0
"Another day of nobody at home understanding the underlying reasons I do things . Why I sleep so much, why I'm in my room all the time, why I eat so much. I sleep so I don't have to deal with things. I'm in my room so I don't bother people. I eat so much because food is the one of the few things that make me happy anymore. I put on the facade for everyone that I'm this optimistic, happy go lucky person, but if people really knew. And God forbid I tell my mom I have depression. She'd yell and tell me I don't. I know somethings wrong. I have something, depression, BPD, ADHD, something! But I'm too poor to be diagnosed and too scared to ever confide in family, to only be told I'm saying this because I want attention. And every day I have to pretend I'm ok.",0
"Everyday I feel better I feel the pain flood back into my heart. I‚Äôm stuck in a terrible spot, I hate my family and now that they know I have depression (friend forced me to tell a teacher) they treat me like I am weak. I hate it, I know I suck but I‚Äôm strong enough to not take my life yet so just stop talking to me, please. I‚Äôm in love with my best friend and that could not be going worse and I want to cut my wrists, slit my throat and just bleed out soon. I would throw myself off a building but I want to do it soon. I just I can‚Äôt take it. Every moment I am not good enough for him and someone else is in his arms I want to do it more. I hate myself more everyday.",1

"I posted before on here about how I'm depressed, a worthless piece of shit and how I tried to hang myself. The driving urge to kill myself faded into a dull ache for a few days and now I'm even more depressed. They say you'll regret suicide but I wish I had the guts to do it sooner. If you could get guns in the UK I'd be gone already &amp;#x200B; Downvoted already. I know no one cares about me but jesus christ",1
"Depends on how much my friends and/or family hate me when I tell them I won't be here for much longer.

"Married to a great guy, two great kids, a job that pays well in the field I went to school for, cuddly cats and dogs. But I‚Äôm bipolar II, major depression issues, anxiety ridden.

"I‚Äôm trying to understand what‚Äôs going on with my current SO, I don‚Äôt fully understand depression nor do I understand self harm. I spent 4 years with my ex who was severely depressed and had suicidal tendencies at his worst points. I tried so hard to be there for him but I eventually gave up when he forced me to leave him because he knew I would be better off without him. Now I‚Äôm with my current boyfriend, who has been amazing and my rock, but he just revealed that his cuts are actually his own doing. I‚Äôve only seen it twice. He‚Äôs a normal happy guy with some family troubles, sometimes financial but he handles things rather well and optimistically. It‚Äôs hard to gauge him at times because he‚Äôs generally a happy guy but he breaks down easily when things start to pile on, understandably so. He is nowhere near how I would describe someone who is depressed, but now I‚Äôm not so sure because of the SH. Can someone help me understand what he might be going through? Should I be worrying for his life? I‚Äôm heartbroken because I hate seeing this pain he‚Äôs going through. I thought it was something I wouldn‚Äôt have to go through again, it was hard going through it in the past. I feel selfish for feeling like this, I feel almost upset that this is happening. Not at him, but at the situation. I don‚Äôt know how to go about this at all, I‚Äôm just trying to see how I could help him.",0
"Literally everything is falling apart. I don‚Äôt know how much more I can take, or want to.

"TLDR: only I can make myself happy again and I know for a fact I‚Äôll never do that, I am hopeless ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî I‚Äôm only making myself feel worse because I have so many things to do and I‚Äôm not doing any of them because I‚Äôm lazy and want to lie in bed all day.

"(I'm not a native english speaker, sorry for all the grammatical errors) I feel like I'm a fucking idiot and that the only reason I succeeded at school was because I was working hard, until now. I'm in my first year of college and the second semester started about a month ago but I feel like everything is falling appart. Two teachers barked at me while strongly implying that I was fucking dumb, I studied for several hours for a test and I ended up failing miserably while most of the class (who didn't study at all) found the test super easy. The worse thing is that the place I'm studying at wasn't even the one my high school teachers recommended me to go, thinking it was ""too easy"" for me, but I went to study here anyway because I felt like I wouldn't psychologically handle the option my high school teachers were recommending me to go to (in fact the day before my math finals in hs I was paralyzed on my bed for more than 30min and couldn't stop cyring thinking I wouldn't pass it despite the days I spent studying it). So currently I feel like that I'm just a dumb idiot and that everyone else is simply smarter than me, and the sole reason as to why I succeeded until now was because I cared about my grades but many didn't. I don't know what to do, I don't even know if I even deserve to post something here, I find myself ridiculous and I'm starting to skip meals.",1

I feel like a burden to people so i find it hard to ask for support. that‚Äôs why i often resort to cries for help. i feel trapped in my own mind. life is exhausting and i can‚Äôt control my emotions.

It‚Äôs been almost a year since I was put on antidepressants and nothings changed. They‚Äôve tried different meds and different doses but it doesn‚Äôt work. At first I was slowly giving up but now I just rapidly feel like nobody can help me like I‚Äôm just a shit stain everyone walks on and I know for a fucking fact I wouldn‚Äôt be missed. Jesus Christ I sound pitiful but god damn it there‚Äôs nothing left for me. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with PTSD recently and they tell me that my depression is from the PTSD but Jesus I feel like I‚Äôm just another mark on the books of a fucked up people. Every day I hope to fucking god I don‚Äôt wake up and every day I do. Everyday it takes me two hours to get to sleep only to have nightmares and wake up after two hours. I‚Äôm so fucking tired and I‚Äôm so fucking done with trying. The universe has won and I feel like now it‚Äôs just waiting with a bowl of popcorn to see how I end. I feel like I‚Äôm constantly screaming and screaming in a room full of people but nobody cares to look nobody hears me. It‚Äôs just so fucking worthless to keep trying it seems.,0

"I was scared he was going to do what he did to me to another little girl, and so I finally reported my bias to the police nearly 6 years after it had ended. There was no physical evidence and so to press charges they need me to testify in court. I‚Äôm going to testify, but then I‚Äôm going to kill myself. Regardless of the verdict, I will have made my disgusting and horrible actions known to the public so history cannot repeat itself, and little girls will be safe from the predator who stole so much from me. It‚Äôs just so much easier to guarantee that my suffering will end than to expect a court to do right thing. In all honestly, I never imagined living this long, I never thought I‚Äôd make it to my senior year of high school. I‚Äôm supposed to go to college in the fall, but I‚Äôll be dead by then. I wish I could do it sooner but I don‚Äôt want to be the coward that let others get hurt when it was preventable.",0

"The only good thing in my life is my girlfriend, her whole family (super religious and conservative) and friends hate me and do everything to stop her from being with me, including telling her they have seen me with other girls, a lie of course (her own mother did that). I was an addict, I did cocaine, crack, benzos. Now I just smoke weed and take LSD occasionally (it actually helps me a lot), also I have tattoos so... the whole combo for them to hate. School sucks obviously, I can't concentrate, I disassociate, I feel worthless and tired all the time. I can't take anxiolytics because of addiction so my head is always full of shit that I can't control, sometimes my paranoia is almost like schizophrenia. Forgive my english and thanks for taking the time to read it.",0
"Sometimes I just cant even. I hate school so much, I hate everything about it. I hate all kinds of work too, I‚Äôm so fucking tired of all off it, having to work hard and try all the time and its still fucking useless, I still cant do jack shit and I am a completely useless piece of human garbage. I hate life I wanna fucking die seriously",1

"I felt too overwhelmed balancing graduate-level schoolwork and a paid internship, and I felt like I wasn't getting as much done as I would have liked, wasting a lot of time. So I asked my advisor via email if I could end my contract early, for the research position I was given. He accepted the resignation, but I've been nervous bringing it up for weeks now. I was worried because I've been coming in late or on some days not at all. My depression is getting worse, and I feel like my antidepressant dosage is too low to be effective. I'm not sure which is a bigger black mark on my resume/needing a future recommendation for a job: not showing up to work because I'm having a depressive episode, or ending the internship to spare them from further episodes. It's the first time I've been employed as a STEM major, and I've completely messed it up. I only have rent money left and then, who knows. I feel so shitty and small, and mostly stupid. I can't possibly say that I've changed my mind now, it'll look too odd after all the rigamarole I went through trying to quit, emailing various advisors and internship coordinators. I'm so tired, and my boyfriend thinks that I've shot myself in the foot and yelled in disbelief. ""I don't know how to make it better,"" he said. I just don't know what to do.

You‚Äôve made promises you never intended to keep. I‚Äôve made choices so we could be together. I‚Äôve pictured a whole life for us. And then you‚Äôve changed your mind. You‚Äôve managed to destroy me. I shouldn‚Äôt have let you destroy me. I was weak in the first place. What‚Äôs the point of being alive and being alone? I don‚Äôt have you anymore, I don‚Äôt have friends. I have work and that‚Äôs all. And work gets boring. You don‚Äôt live just to work. I just feel like I‚Äôm ready to give up.

"I've tried every path possible to stop my pain. Counseling so far seemed like it failed. I'm trying extremely hard at everything but the universe likes to play a reverse card and send me back to the put I just came from. I'm just constantly losing and whenever I do win it's only for a millisecond. I'm literally extremely humble and nice but in a way I can't be used and the universe still trashes me for it. I'm trying just so hard. People say it's going to get better but how it's been going only downhill and I'm doing nothing to cause this. I always feel fake, empty, and soulless but all I want I to feel feel and be full of emotions, but the world I've seen is built to destroy me and continue to get me farther from that. I honestly want to be able to be comforted by my friends by nothing fucking works I'm literally both an Anti-introvert and anti-extrovert,nothing works for me.

I'm always afraid to tell anyone though or my therapist bc every time I talk about people get concerned. I don't know maybe I am alone in this but the best way to describe it is: like a fly in a contained room. You'll always hear the buzz, and sometimes it constant and droning in your ear, but other times you can barely hear, like a soft quick buzz. I mean its never gone away. I am only 18 but I have never had a time where I didn't think about killing myself. I'm okay now, the fly is rather quiet but like is this normal?",0

I stayed in my room all day, not leaving for food or the bathroom. I just sat there and thought about ending it. I had a belt I could kill myself with. It felt like the only thing to do since I feel like I burden my family and friends. When I put the belt around my neck and pulled, I couldn't do it. I couldn't just leave. My parents know I'm not doing good in school, but I could never tell them about what happened. I just need help but I feel weak or stupid going to get help. I really just wanna drop out and find a job I can work my way up from, but that'll disappoint my entire family. I don't know why I do this shit to myself.

People say self isolating is bad and you shouldn‚Äôt do it and should surround yourself with friends and family but honestly sometimes self isolating is less hurtful.

I feel like I have no hobbies, I try play games but I lose interest after 5 minutes, I try work on Writing or Drawing and I lose any motivation almost instantly.

I'm not going to explain why I want to commit suicide, but I do want to ask what I should think of before choosing to make the ultimate decision. I'm not talking about, ""Think of how sad your mom will be!""

"When I was 15-16 years old, I posted here in my darkest moments. I couldn't see any reason to keep living. I thought I was nothing special and the next 8 years seemed like an endless slog. You can look through my post history if you want. Since then, I graduated college and graduate school. I have traveled the world. I swam with bioluminescent algae in Indonesia. I've hiked among alpacas in Peru. I learned to speak Spanish fluently and connected with people around the world, and in my own country, who speak Spanish too. I've published my writing i multiple publications. I have fallen in love and had my heart broken several times. I realized I'm gay, came out, and I'm with the most amazing woman. I have a career that I love where I help people every day. I can honestly say that depression may be a lifelong struggle for me, but it is possible to recover and develop tools to cope with it. Every day is a manageable challenge now. Every day I am grateful to just be alive. I am SO GLAD that I didn't kill myself 8 years ago. I never would have known how beautiful my life could become.

I went through middle school, high school and college without playing any sports. I wish my parents forced me into it or that I force myself. But now I‚Äôm 24. I can‚Äôt run 2 minutes without being out of breath. I‚Äôm unhealthy. I snore like a pig.",0

"I suffered with depression for many years, and haven recently reached a turning point in my life where I finally feel good again, but somethings a little off, all my emotions are less extreme, sadness passes in minutes now and is nowhere near the intensity is was before, but I feel this weird longing to feel an emotion to that same depth and extreme again, has anyone else experienced this? Or am I going mad? It‚Äôs like I was so used to the emotion everything else feels uncomfortable now. I feel so stupid for feeling like this, I‚Äôm lucky enough to (it appears so far) gotten past the darkness that defined my teens and early adulthood, and I have this sick lust to feel it again? It also come with this constant creeping fear that this ‚Äòok‚Äôness I‚Äôm feeling now is a facade, that soon something will happen and I will fall back into my old state instantly. The conflict of this fear and the longing is driving me a little mad. I can‚Äôt talk to anyone I know about it because I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm gonna sound insane, so I guess I‚Äôm asking you guys. TLDR: recovered from depression but missing the depth to which I felt emotions before, missing the release that comes with sadness of that extreme, every other emotion feels a little uncomfortable now, Anyone else experienced this?",0
"I am mature student in, Toxic class mates, basically today i was older than the teacher i hate myself i want die, i had car accident 2 years ago i wish i died in it why i have to live to see this, every goddamn person i know has done much more than me in his life, i hate myself, i live in the 4th floor best thing is jumping",1

As a kid I was afraid to be left alone in the house when my parents were at work and I‚Äôm having an exact same feeling again. I took xanax to calm myself down but this lingering feeling of something might happen to me is really bothering me. I also have other bad memories of being left alone so I‚Äôm assuming those memories are also affecting me. I‚Äôm really scared and I hope I have someone or even a pet that can keep my company. Just wanted to talk it out so I don‚Äôt stay paralyzed on my bed. If you have any tips to get through this (the break is until this weekend) please lmk :(",0

I'm tearing up as I write this, so go ahead and fucking say what you're gonna fucking say. My reasons you will probably laugh at if I told you. Would probably tell me this and that and other shit. Tell me to get the fuck over it but again, I'm at the point where I look at ways to kill myself knowing I CAN'T. Because I know I will fuck up other people. I am in living fucking Purgatory. Whatever. Say what ever the fuck you're gonna goddamn say.",0
"I never had a best friend. I'd never been part of a friend group. Or *a* group for that matter. I never felt accepted, not at my temporary job as a waiter, not in online chats, not in my class. Never had a girlfriend. Never kissed. Never had sex. Never had someone compliment me. Never had an unforgettable holiday trip. Never had a memorable spring break or summer break. Never went to a cool festival. Never had a great party. Never hosted one either. The list goes on and on and on. I feel lonely and my depression is physically weighing down on me. I have no motivation to do anything any more and my parents say they can read that off my face. I legit cannot remember the last time I had fun. Why would I even bother going on like this when I feel like I am just surviving each day rather than living. I am almost tempted to move to another country, start anew, and just go entirely crazy, but I feel like I would carry on the same way and be even more depressed. Everyone around me has so much fun but me. Last week I overheard two normal guys around my age discussing their plans for the summer and some crazy memories. I wanted to kill myself so badly hearing what I missed out on. FUCK",0
"I'm not a believer of anything spiritual or supernatural, but it truly does feel like I was cursed with bad luck or some shit. A lot of it is just small things. Constantly getting the worst loot in video games, missing the public bus by like 30 seconds, etc. I always make small personal bets with myself like if I get a notification on Instagram I'll just be like ""I bet this specific person didn't like this post"" and I look at the notification and it's exactly that. This kind of shit is constantly happening everyday. By themselves it's not bad at all, but it really builds up and starts eating away at you. And then there's bigger things. Like being 5'2 as a male is pretty bad. I have mental illnesses and some of it I can't even relate with other mentally ill people. I get bronchitis like every fucking year. And then tonight, I just got news that a field trip to Hawaii that I've been looking forward to for FOUR FUCKING YEARS has been cancelled because of the coronavirus bullshit. Of course it had to be the ONE FUCKING YEAR IM A SENIOR AND ABLE TO GO. It just all piles up so fucking much. I feel like I'll just constantly have bad luck in life. It makes me lose excitement in things I'm actually excited for because I'm just in that mindset that it'll go wrong because of my bad luck. Makes me wonder if it's even worth living if I'm just stuck with this shit. Again, I don't believe in karma or the supernatural or anything, but this shit really makes me question it.",0

"I used to be concerned with my image too, until once I came up with a little thought experiment. Imagine that you live in a world where you look to others the way you feel, and depending on how good you feel inside how good you appear to others. This is kind of real for hormones and these produce pheromones. Anyone can feel a certain way within, and this has a direct impact in others. Not only that, but the fact that most of the time you are not looking at yourself, the only thing you percieve of yourself is how you feel, so focus on just that. &amp;#x200B; We live in a world where everyone is self conscious, so never think people are observing you more than that people are just focused on how the world percieves them, just what happens to you, so come out of that mental trancestate and be one of the few people that can burst out of that bubble.",0
5 days ago i slit my wrists again. I was feeling like absolute shit and wanted a reason for why i felt like i did.

She forgot even why she wanted to be angry with me for, we went IKEA to look at new stuff for her apartment and then we went to a cafe in which I took a selfie of us. We were so happy and cute together. That selfie popped up on my one year memories. Fast forward to now, we've been separated since end of October last year. She doesn't talk with me, she removed me from everything except Facebook. I am hurting every fucking day. I remember her, I remember all the good times we had, I remember the future plans we had with each other. I don't know exactly when she turned from loving me to leaving me. But I just wish she spoke to me about any concerns she was having. I made my mistakes too by not understanding exactly what she wanted. I just want that happiness we had a year ago. I just miss her so much. We both wanted to get married, but I told her, once I finish school or get a job, we will get married! She told me she loved me and always will. I told her I loved her unconditionally. I wish somehow we could redo our relationship because we fit together so damn well. But, not in this lifetime I guess...",0

I think about death and dying still very frequently, especially if anything goes wrong.",0
"I don‚Äôt like to complain and so I don‚Äôt talk about my depression a lot to my friends/loved ones, I don‚Äôt want to worry them or be annoying. It‚Äôs been getting progressively worse recently though, I‚Äôm dropping weight like crazy (I‚Äôve never had it interfere with weight before), when I do try to talk about it, things get minimized and nobody really gives a f*ck. I had my s/o tell me that I was ‚Äúnot really sad‚Äù yesterday, and that messed with me because not only has he not known me for the majority of my life, but just because I don‚Äôt like to talk about my problems doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt exist. He really has no idea. My mom is a therapist so when I try to talk to her she just gets overly worried, and my dad generally follows her lead with that. I understand why they worry, a couple years ago I had a pretty bad suicide attempt and a near fatal overdose (od was an accident, I was just being dumb) within less than 6 months of each other, they worry that it‚Äôll happen again. It gets annoying though because I feel like I can‚Äôt even say I‚Äôm sad without ‚Äúare you on drugs again‚Äù etc. Now that I think about it maybe this post doesn‚Äôt make sense/ is all over the place, I guess it‚Äôs easier to vent to strangers on the internet than the people in my life.",0

Not a day goes by where I don't think about doing it, but I always think 'Maybe your friends can help. Maybe you can get better.' I've just been lying to myself. I've been at the edge for a long time now, but I'm just exhausted at this point. I just can't. Why does life have to be like this? Why can't we just be happy all the time? Why do feelings like this have to exist? I hate it. I just want to go to sleep. Thank you for letting me rant.",0

I can tell that i'm isolating myself from all of my friends. I rarely answer texts and if i'm invited to go out, i either don't respond or make up an excuse. Lots of people have told me they miss seeing me but no one has considered asking me how i'm doing. I feel like i'm being selfish by wanting them to ask me how i am rather than going to them and talking about how badly i'm struggling to just go about my everyday life. I also don't want to go to them with this kind of thing because it's a pretty heavy topic to just bring up out of the blue and i don't want to scare anyone.

On valentine's Day this year I was put on Zoloft after finally going back to the doctors. I have had CBT and counseling in the past but just nothing seems to work and it's all too much for me to cope with.

I want to kill myself and be done with it, but theres so many things I need to work out. Who will find my body? How will I do it? Will it hurt? Who should I give my belongings and pets to? Anyway, I just want someone to listen to me and to talk to me about how I really feel. Everyone always brushes me off. Nobody listens to anything I say, I feel so alone. I‚Äôm not sure if I truly want to die or if I just want to hurt myself badly enough to be hospitalised for a few weeks. I‚Äôm scared to truly die, but is it strange to want to hurt myself and be hospitalised for a while? I want to take a break from my life and be somewhere with people who understand and will take care of me. I feel like the only way I‚Äôll be able to escape is if I attempt suicide and am hospitalised, and they‚Äôll finally have to take me seriously. Is this a crazy thought?

I've been rejected to several colleges/programs already, some of which I thought I had a decent shot at getting into. Occasionally, I have what I think are real suicidal impulses, but I know that I'm too much of a fucking pussy to do anything about it. The closer and closer I get to graduation, the lower my work ethic stoops, and the worse I feel about the utterly pathetic excuse of a human being that I now am.

"I've lost interest in everything i used to be passionate about before, cant seem to enjoy or appreciate anything in life anymore. always feeling somehow empty and pointless, always looking for might be the missing thing in my life. I tried a lot of things and nothing actually works it only gives that temporary satisfaction only to realize that nothing have changed and i still feel the same way. I don't wanna jump to conclusions and say I'm depressed but tbh idk what it is that I'm feeling anymore. life just seems like a chore, going to uni just to get a degree, work, make money and pay back my parents, I'm not even interested in what I'm studying anymore. I'm so unsatisfied and disappointed in myself and don't want my parents to know or feel that their only son is a complete failure. i would appreciate any tips or advice because I'm clueless.",1
"I feel like there‚Äôs just so much pain in this world and I hate seeing others go through it (poverty, sickness, etc.). So I just feel sad. It‚Äôs almost like seeing other people sad makes me sad. I am of course anxious about things in my personal life, but lately that hasn‚Äôt been bothering me as much and I‚Äôve just been experiencing a general depression that I haven‚Äôt experienced since high school. Does anyone else relate to this?? Just feeling sad bc there‚Äôs so many horrible things in this world?",0
I'm 15 and my mom decided to homeschool me and my siblings and it fucked us over. The only subjects that I'm where I should be in are math and history and I don't even know basic grammar.so my life is fucked and I'm just a burden to society,1
Everyday I could be fine but eventually the thought of my death creeps in to my thought and it makes me sad. I have been questioning what is on the other side all my life and sometimes I just think I should kill myself to get it over with. My friends don't help either most of the are sorta surface level and the ones closest to me are the most negative. I just want to have fun in life I'm only 16 why do I think about it so much ? I don't even care to experience homeschool anymore I am just trying to go to college.,0
"I battle with depression and tried to kill myself 2 weeks back, I chickened out just before I passed out and called a friend for help. Does that surreal feeling ever go away? How do you get your life back? I don't want to fall back into old habits as that's how I got to the darkest place I have ever been... But it's so damn hard! I am on meds and they seem to be helping but honestly I feel like I am staring at a black wall with no hope of escape!",0
"Can somebody on this sub go back in time, and stop me from making the decision to ""focus on my happiness""? Last year (2 days before my 25th birthday) I made this decision, and I fucking regret it. I'm realizing how hopeless my situation is, and I have the energy and motivation to throw myself off of a cliff now. I decided that I'm going to kill myself before I turn 30 unless things change. There's no way that I can live life so isolated, and trapped in my own head. Edit: To whoever commented ""K bye"", why did you delete your post or block me lol?",0
"My parents don‚Äôt care, my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù are sick of me, and no one else gives a shit because everyone has their own shit to deal with. Not even you guys care. We are all just hear so feel slightly less pathetic because other people are here in the same boat as us. I just feel completely alone and I‚Äôm just pissed off I can‚Äôt find it in myslef to just fucking do what I want to do already. I want this shit to stop.",0
It‚Äôs finals time in school. I‚Äôve been more stressed out then usual and my meds dont seem to work. Last night it just got to much to handle and I cut myself it felt good during the moment but now I feel terrible. I was doing so good I was almost a year cut free. I‚Äôm worried that my parents might mind out now and I‚Äôll have to have a talk with them. Why did I make such a stupid decision I hate myself for this,1
"I have run into 2 major problems in my life atm, it has been eating away at me for the better part of a month. I‚Äôll give you some backstory: I have people pleaser all my life. I feel like I have always gone with the flow, with people‚Äôs expectations of me rather than have my own. I have done that since I was a kid and I‚Äôm now turning 20 this year, And with that being said the first problem I have run into is, I don‚Äôt know what I want and like partly due to the depression. But mostly due to the fact that I‚Äôve never really done or said what I wanted to to outside forces shutting me down at every turn (school, parents etc.). Idk and it‚Äôs driving me up a wall. 2: I thought hard about the people pleaser trait in my being a lot and I have come to this conclusion, I hate who I am. I believe that I am selfish and feel because I haven‚Äôt done what I have wanted in my life I am inauthentic. So I go and look for outside validation and love because I feel like I am incapable of it. But when I receive it, and it doesn‚Äôt hit the way I wanted it to or things are too fast or far. Like a addict I dump them and look for a new person to give me that feeling I long for. It‚Äôs fucked up, because the other people care about me and I do to to an extent, but I prioritize my own feelings and shit first. And that realization fucked me up so bad. Real bad. Any thoughts would be great because I‚Äôm so lost rn. Thanks",0
"I am 28, no friends, no close relatives, no girl, no skills, still living with parents and my brother, no dreams, no nothing, not a single will to live. Last January I almost drowned swimming in the ocean and while drowning, I realized it‚Äôs okay it‚Äôs gonna be over but I was rescued. So I tried to live these months to see if I can. But I do not if I can anymore. I need to stop pretending that it‚Äôs all gonna be ok. Yeah. So I have no future really. Why live.",0
It's so hard just to get out of bed every morning. Right now I just want to die. It's too damn hard just to be alive in this world. I don't want to keep going. I don't want to keep fighting. I just wish it would all end and I could have peace. All I ever asked for out of life was for love. All I ever wanted was love. This world took that request and turned it back on me in the form of a million daggers to the heart. I can't bear it any more. I want to die.,0
"Ever since my break up, I'm so lonely and depressed, if I did not have my son I wouldn't make it probably. I'm still in love with my ex and it hurts to be separated for six months. After six years what happened to it all. My family drives me nuts, in going to be so glad to get my own place soon. I'm about to break down in tears living crammed up with annoying family can be such a drag. I'm about to pull my hair out and break down in tears.",0
"I just turned 25 last month. i have always been poor, i have no family, no car, tons of debt, shit credit. Im always bitter, i get frustrated by everything at work and at home. Activities i used to find fun just agitate me now, everything is just a fucking mental obstacle course even if its the simplest of tasks. i put myself through college by taking out loans and i cant even find a career in my field. I just despise myself and am so god damn bitter, i feel like theres an internal scream roaring in my head at all times. i cant afford a gun and i know my roommate has one but i can never find it. im so desperate, i am so so desperate to just make this stop",0
"Im scared that one day I may not be strong enough, not thoughtful enough, not hopeful enough... and end up doing it... you all know that one word, the one that's frightening and unbearable to say or even type. Suicide :(",0
"For the longest time, I couldn't see myself living past 25. This mostly came about towards the last year of University and got worse around the end of 2017, when I wasn't landing work. In 2018, I met someone and suddenly I felt alive again. I felt calm and collected. Although I was stuck in the same loop of applying for work, it didn't feel as tiresome. In 2019, I got accepted into medicine and moved overseas. My partner starts tearing us apart 3 weeks into my move... I drop out of med school because the stresses from the break up became way too much to handle. Especially since I was overseas. Now I am back to applying for jobs in my old degree and getting nowhere. I am heavily depressed. I can't see myself past 25 again. I have this strong feeling I will die this year. Atm, I welcome death with open hands... I am tired of life constantly shifting on me. :'(",0
"Since this year started I feel like all I do is keep screwing up, I thought I could make life better compared to last year, but instead I‚Äôve f*cked it up more and want nothing but either the end or to just get away from this town, this city, everything and everyone. I have nothing anymore, and I have no one. I‚Äôd rather be dead than feeling at this point.",0
"People will treat you like shit regardless. You can give your best to people and they will still treat you how they want to. I am done trying to be good to people who aren‚Äôt good to me. The funny part is after it‚Äôs all said and done, you will still feel like the bad guy even though you weren‚Äôt in that situation. I just don‚Äôt care enough to live in a world that doesn‚Äôt care about me.",0
"Ive been depressed for like forever. Im ugly , no one likes me im a loser and im just always sad and i cant do anything about it. Ppl have told tht my life is better if were dead. Life just sucks",1
I feel like dying rn. Don't worry I won't do it. It feels like inner me has just died. In a way I am kind of at peace with it. I wouldn't mind if I just died right now.,0
Day after day. I‚Äôve been isolated so long I‚Äôm beginning to actually despise people. I used to loathe the idea of hating all other humans but this isolation is starting to get to me. I just expect the same from everyone I meat. It doesn‚Äôt matter anymore to me. It makes no difference weather I try or not. Everyone feels the same. I thought I needed friends so I went out and talked to people. Nobody wants to hangout with me after school or work. I tried. My life is just pathetic no matter what I do and yes I never hang out with my so called friends. I try way to hard with people because I just want them so badly to stay with me maybe that pushes them away. I have no one. I just want things to change...,0
what‚Äôs the point of trying to better yourself when there are things that you just can‚Äôt fix? because in the end those‚Äôll be the things that everyone else laughs at even though you have no control over it. the whole idea of bettering yourself fucking sucks when there are things you can‚Äôt change anyways. what a sick fucking joke.,0
"I‚Äôve always wanted to find my soulmate, but I‚Äôm so scared that no one will ever love me back. I know that this is the stupidest reason to be sad about but romance is something that I‚Äôve dreamed of since I was a kid. No one likes me in a romantic way. There has only been one person who had a crush on me in my entire life and it lasted a only a month. Everyday I find out that my friends are dating people and they post pictures with their significant others and every time I see those posts I feel like crying.",0
"I have no real life friends, I sometimes talk to people during school about mutual subjects but never get called up after school or on the weekends. I have decent grades and I live comfortably but no one likes me. I try to be approachable I try to be nice it‚Äôs always the ‚Äúshut up I didn‚Äôt ask‚Äù or ‚Äúgo away, no one wants you here,‚Äù I‚Äôm going to a therapist this Friday but I‚Äôm tired of living in a constant state of loneliness and isolation. I‚Äôve begun to slit my area of my arm from my shoulder to the elbow. I don‚Äôt want people to see or know that I‚Äôm in pain. Everyday I go to school with a smile on my face. I come home and cry. No one likes me. I have nothing. I am worthless. I don‚Äôt know what I was hoping to accomplish by saying this but hey, that‚Äôs my story. üòï",1
"I am a weak and small person that know one respects. I am treated like shit and abandon by society. I am aggressive to people. I think about murdering and killing others. I take out rage on myself and pretend to slaughter the people that constantly disrespect and hurt me. I like the grey sky that gives the depressing tone. I like gore and violence and doing things that I find somewhat happiness towards but I fall into this void of grief and sorrow. I am a hopeless one. I am loading the bullet and not caring for what anyone thinks. I don't care for life anymore. I am accepting my fate. I am glad that I am choosing to kill myself because it gives my a mature understanding of the cold and brutal reality of the human race. I don't go to counselors or therapists. I like being this way. Cold and sad makes me feel happy. I have lost interest in friends, activities and prefer to be alone. I am a sad and pathetic human being and wanted to say goodbye to the ones I cared about which is practically 0. I am a loser that hangs myself with a guitar string and is bullied daily. Thank you for the some out there that might of cared. I fell safe on the internet but not in real life. I hope my death is brutal and long so I can feel as much harm humanly possible to I die. I don't care if there is nothing after death. I am just typing to I feel a feeling in my heart. Goodbye. 3/5/2020 suicide date",1
"Laying bed listening to Joji and wishing I just didn‚Äôt live on this Earth. I‚Äôm just so tired of existing. The stress is unbearable I don‚Äôt know what to do. Just fucking venting on my phone because it sucks. Reasons to not off myself; 1) my sister moved in with my for university, 2) my mother.",0
"Growing up, people always tell me that I will be somebody and I can be whoever I wanna be if I put my mind into it, 10 years passed turns out I'm a nobody with no motivation to live. Looking back, I wanna hug my old self and tell him to cherish every moment of being a young kid because the world is a harsh place to everyone and you'll also be a victim of society. I'm nothing, worthless, and nobody. If I die nothing would happen... The world around me would still be the same... People die every day, so what would make it different if I disappear? NOTHING! I decided to hang myself in the bathroom. I cried with pain and satisfaction that I will be leaving this earth then the shower curtain rod in my bathroom broke... It was a loud thud but luckily everyone's asleep... I proceeded to cry in silence and thinking about what should I do? I'm ugly, worthless, piece of crap, and a waste of oxygen... My acne scars make me feel like I'm nothing... Everything about me is SHIT. I wanna die... or be murdered so I can blame somebody for my death. I don't wanna live anymore...",1
"So, pretty much. I‚Äôve been dealing with depression &amp; anxiety for quite a number of years, but I‚Äôve going through a real low, rough patch at the moment. My self hatred has been growing rapidly &amp; to top it off, me and my now ex girlfriend broke up the other day. I was just wondering if any of you could just comment some positive things like inspiration and whatnot? Thank you all in advance. I hope everyone that‚Äôs reading this right now are coping alright, you‚Äôre never alone ‚ù§Ô∏è",1
"So I recently went to a therapist, because I have severe depression. I cannot afford to keep going, and I was hoping someone might have some suggestions or exercises in general to stop feeling sad. I‚Äôm looking for things I can do on a daily basis to improve over time. Any help is appreciated!",0
"My friends hype me up so much, and God love 'em for it, but there's just this enormous disconnect between how valuable they I say I am, and the level of value I feel and witness from potential dates and love interests. I don't know why it has to be this way. I don't know why I should be so painfully alone, and feel so unlovable.",0
"I think I really want and end now, I‚Äôm not gonna do it soon though everyone will be so beat up about not being able to to help. I‚Äôm gonna just get back on with things and work and get another job and earn as much money as possible and I‚Äôll eat and workout and I‚Äôll do everything I planned to with this year. I‚Äôll go to all the therapy and the assessments. I‚Äôll stop with social media and wean people away slowly I guess and I‚Äôll move away again like every knows I always planned to and then I‚Äôll go. I‚Äôve been here before and then I felt hope that one day I‚Äôd be okay but I‚Äôm back there again, I never ever wanted to feel this again. To be honest I‚Äôll probably end up feeling okay but the fear of feeling like this again it‚Äôs worth those periods of okay. I wasn‚Äôt meant to be here and I‚Äôm sorry to everyone. I have every wish I‚Äôve ever prayed for now and I still feel numb, i only ever wanted to feel happy. I go out with euphoria as planned and I‚Äôll mention no one in my note you all deserve so much better. I don‚Äôt see anything else fixing this",0
"My family hates me. I have no friends. I have no college degree and have had 7 jobs in the last 3 years. I‚Äôm absolutely defeated. I‚Äôve lost enjoyment in all things, I truly do not understand why I‚Äôm here. I guess I care enough about the people around me to not upset them but I am truly not in this for myself anymore. This just fucking sucks",0
"I'm a 26 year old male. I'm always, ALWAYS worried about something. It could be big, or it could be small, but no matter what im always worried. When I say worried, I'm not talking about your everyday anxiety. I'm talking about constant panic attacks. Im 26, and I've had people guess I'm 40. The only time I have relief is in my sleep. Everytime things seem to be looking up, something always manages to go wrong. My anxiety has turned into rage over the years, and I'm getting closer, and closer to snapping everyday. I clean brathrooms for a living, and someone could so much as ask me if they could use the bathroom as I'm trying to clean it, and I want to rip their heads off there fucking shoulders. I'm almost afraid I might hurt someone soon, as I feel I have nothing to live for anymore. I've felt how I do for the past 10 years, and it's not getting any better. I'm a vile person. I've been told by countless people, that I'm a vile person. If you knew what I've done, youd think I was a vile person. Theres no turning back from the things I've done, that's why i have nothing to lose, and i feel it's time to inflict my pain upon others. The thought of disappointing my parents, and them seeing me for the monster I am comforts me. I really dont see me living this life much longer.",1
"My mom relies on marijuana and other pain relieving drugs to get through her day. She takes her frustrations out on me. Calls me lazy and other names daily. I fucking try my best, and its hard. Why does no-one understand!. She's gonna be so fucking upset when i kill myself, or will she? Life would be so much better for her. I wanna give up. Im exhausted.",0
"Every interaction just feels fake. I always want to be the popular guy (charismatic) considering I dont have many friends if any and hide away from people spending at least 15 hours a day in a room watching tv shows I've seen 100s of times. I just dont want to do anything. I have no interest in starting hobbys. I go to the gym and during the work out. Theres just a constant your not good enough, people are just being nice and dont really like you, they know your fake and try hard. Im conscious of everything how I walk, talk etc. I cant seem to accept myself, struggle with being authentic and just fill myself with information on the subject. I know I have to stop being a bitch and get a grip but it's like an internal battle and its exhausting. It's like I cant just let go for some reason. I basically live in my mind with thoughts of being inadequate or fake in all areas, slowing falling into a victim role. I dont know who I am. If that makes sence. Any suggestions or people who can relate ?",0
I'm so happy that I'm dropping out but now I got more things to worry about. Nicee,0
"Everyday, I‚Äôm wishing and hoping that the next day would be different. Hoping that everytime I wake up, I wake up in the reality not this nightmare anymore. But the more I hope, the higher I fall. Exhausted of everything it won‚Äôt change. I just want to end it.",0
"The method of suicide I selected is hypothermia. There's a river near my house with 40 degree water Fahrenheit, 4 degrees Celsius. Being in there at night, no one would see me. I would tie a rope to a life jacket and confine myself to a tree so I don't drift along the current to a spot where someone would find me. Death would occur within a couple of hours of being in the water, and unconsciousness would happen before then. This method is easy to pull off because it doesn't involve highly intense pain, and I can get out if I really want to. The problem is that this isn't going to work soon, due to the warmer seasons approaching. I have to quickly decide if I want to die. I'm afraid that if I don't act now, I'll regret it and have to endure life for another year, but I'm also not 100% set on death just yet.",0
"There are probably serial killers who sleep easier at night and with fewer regrets than me and I try so dang hard to be nice to people. I want to support my friends the best I can. If anyone else I knew said this I‚Äôd be reassuring them in a second. Why can‚Äôt this apply to me, why do I hate myself",1
"So I like to help people through their suicidal thoughts. I really do. But sometimes when helping people I feel like a fraud knowing one day sooner than later, I'm going to end my own life. I always say in my head that I'm helping those who are going through a rough period in their lives and that it will get better for them. I truly believe that. I just don't believe I'm ever going to get better. I kinda know better for myself. This has been something I've lived with forever, what's the point in lying to myself.",0
"I'm 24, all I have is a shitty degree in translation, no job, no close friends. I feel like such a disappointment, my life is going nowhere, I wake up and I have to face that I'm a faliure compared to my sister and brother every single day. I see no point in living, I'm just a burden to my parents so I feel like it doesnt matter what happens in the future, I'll end up killing myself. I know is going to sound dramatic but I feel it in my cells - I'm going to kill myself at some point in my life. I wish I could do it right now but at least I wanna save some money to pay for the funeral and the other stuff. I don't wanna be a burden in death lol.",1
"There is so much shit going on right now, my mom has terminal cancer, the family dogs being put to sleep tonight, my sister is extremely ill and is potentially going to lose her baby, she 6 months pregnant, my partner is off work with mental health issues and can't leave the house so I'm working every hour I can just to keep a roof over our head. I'm trying so hard to be there for every one but it feels like no one is there for me. I can't do this. It's breaking me.",0
"I've made a whole google doc sheet about how I'm going to kill myself and it looks pretty good with 31 ways in the list. I don't have any emotional support around, my mum would just give me silent treatment when I say how I feel. I get anxiety attacks often a lot of times and it's really hard for me to open up around here. Should've just stayed in college than come at the wrong place (ie. Here). When I get any idea of my own, they'd shut it down or give no response. I don't know if I'm even going to survive in any corporate workplace.",0
"The reason I drink is to self medicate because I saw my friend pass away in a car accident when I was 19. We were both stupid and I challenged him to a race using our parents cars. Basically, he understeered into a tree. I have tried therapy but it didn't work for me. I was also diagnosed with PTSD and depression. I stopped taking my prescription because it didn't work for me. I feel that I have blood on my hands because I was the one who made him do it. My parents and grandfather came to me and told me that they were worried about my drinking problem. I sometimes drink a bottle of Vodka a day. I just want to drink myself to death. My granddad tried to relate to the situation by telling me about the things he was in Vietnam. I walked out because I was upset about everything. I now think that I was out of order and I would do anything to apologise. But at the same time, I feel that they shouldn't have bought my grandfather along because he is getting Parkinsons disease so I don't want him to worry about me as well.",0
I‚Äôve lost all my friends over the past year. Got dumped by me gf last year. Nobody checks up on me. Girls don‚Äôt even wanna talk to me. I‚Äôm so lonely. I don‚Äôt think I can take it much longer. I‚Äôm tired of praying. I don‚Äôt believe in god anymore. Every time I pray it brings nothing. Everyday that passes makes me realize how worthless my life is. I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.i think I‚Äôm gonna end it in about a week after I have time to get things together and write a few notes.,0
"Throwaway, because all my friends and such know my account. I know they care, and that's what hurts me the most. My head has always been a conflicting cloud of thoughts. I keep thinking if I were to die, maybe everybody would be happier. Maybe I'll stop being such a fuck up. Maybe everybody would think of me as this better version of myself after I'm gone. I'm young, and I know there's so much ahead for me, that maybe one day things will get better. But it's been so incredibly hard, and I don't think I can do it anymore. My stay at the psych ward made me behind in school, it made me feel selfish for wanting to work on myself, that I was causing pain for others. I sometimes think that maybe if I was gone, people wouldn't need to worry anymore. I wouldn't need to go chat to certain people to feel better. I wouldn't stay in bed and cry all day about how much I just want to disappear. I've been thinking about hanging myself, but after reading about how much it gets fucked up, I'm starting to think of a different method. I don't know. I just feel as if today is going to be my last.",0
"It‚Äôs a very long story but to shorten it a bit. I‚Äôm getting kicked out of crisis housing for having my dog which they knew about, on the property. Just gonna state here that she was apart of my agreement because she‚Äôs going to be a service dog for me. They‚Äôve now changed there minds 4 months later &amp; saying that I can stay but she can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm basically being forced to be homeless &amp; no one really seems to care. I‚Äôve been reaching out to those I love... but nothing. All too busy or something better. I know they say don‚Äôt give up, it‚Äôll get there but when? For the past 2 years I had cancer, after I found out I was in remission &amp; this program a youth organisation had accepted me, the Australian bush fires started which effected my family home. I lost my granddad as well now they‚Äôre doing this. Just when is it gonna end",0
"I keep looking at ways to kill myself. I doubt the little store in town would have what i need to be successful. I have a 3500$ medical bill thay beeds to be paid off and i don't have thst kind of money. I'm working three 12s at work but apparently that's not enough because I need to somehow get a 4 hour shift. Can't find the person i need to ask about that, if it's even possible. I'm tired. I don't wabt to be here anymore and no one is listening. Prolly shouldnt have posted on my main account but i doubt anyone knows I habe a reddit, so i guess there's that.",0
"I see memes everyday and occasionally nose exhale, but shit I just don‚Äôt have that same vibe anymore. I hate being alone all the time, I won‚Äôt even speak for an entire week because I have no one to talk to here at college. Doesn‚Äôt help when my only friend group at home is breaking apart slowly. Shit hurts. Can‚Äôt fucking talk to anyone, don‚Äôt know how to keep conversations going even over text with new people.",0
"My mood fluctuations have not changed over the past year at all, despite me starting medication. However what I have noticed is that I'm able to contextualise thoughts and feelings a lot easier these days. For example I'm feeling fairly rubbish at the moment, but instead of the thoughts of loneliness and inadequacy I used to get with these feelings, I now just look forward to not feeling like this. It comes in waves and always has done, but I'm feeling it is affecting my productivity a lot less than it used to, obviously I'm more productive when I'm not feeling like this, but by Monday I probably won't feel like this. I used to have thoughts of ending it, still do sometimes but I'm glad I didn't. I'm much happier now that I know it's not constant. I hope anyone who currently feels as though they're in a trough can see that it won't always be this way, and there are sunnier days ahead.",0
"I called the hotline, and said exactly that. And honestly I don‚Äôt know what I was expecting. But what I got was a dude who read off a bunch of questions. I answered. Then I got transferred to a sassy lady who informed me that she could either send out a team to collect me and take me to the hospital, or she could call 911. I repeated myself. I can‚Äôt afford the hospital. The lady told me those are my options. I‚Äôve been dealing with some mental health issues since I was a kid, but they‚Äôve really exploded in the last 2-3 years. I get why people with depression kill themselves. I don‚Äôt want to die because I‚Äôm sad. I want to die because this is going to happen for the rest of my life, and I cannot agree to that. I never thought I‚Äôd be a person who would do this, but I‚Äôve been strongly considering it even when I‚Äôm not sad. Help. I don‚Äôt want to hurt myself, but I can‚Äôt do this again and again. I can‚Äôt.",0
"I thought everything was fine, we even had plans to hang out that day, she said she loved me, I said I loved her. Then that night she told me she couldn't be in a relationship with me. She left me in the dust with nothing. She was my best friends but also my only friend in my state since I moved. I have no one now and I feel like I lost a part of myself",0
"I dont deserve love. Im fucked up and im a mess. The reason why i dont have a relationship is because i feel like people deserve something better than me. Im shit. Im trash. No one loves me and the few who tried gave up. They all gave up. At my funeral who will cry ? I guess people would not even show up. No one cares. I have no friends texting me, im just the guy in the group no one is best friend with but i still hang out. Im alone. Im lost. Im drinking again, dont know what else to do to numb the pain. Maybe my death will end this. I deserve death not love. Maybe ill die tomorow. Maybe in 10 years. Only time will tell. I survived 4 suicide attemps for this life and nothing is doing better.",1
"I‚Äôm 17, and I‚Äôve been feeling this way ever since I was 15. I have no friends, social anxiety and I‚Äôve been homeschooled since I was 5. And to top it all off, I have asperger‚Äôs syndrome. I‚Äôd give away everything I have just to have at least one real friend who understands me and just to be normal. My anxiety has gotten so bad that I can barely even go out anymore. I for some reason have a huge fear of kids around my age. I almost had a panic attack just for checking out my new college with my mum. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever make it there. I like a lot of stuff that I‚Äôm sure no one my age likes and I get angry at my relatives for no reason. I hate being a teen. Why do hormones exist? Why is everything so complicated? Why am I losing my mind? I never used to have to worry about any of this shit as a little kid. I wish I could go back in time and undo whatever the fuck it was that made me this way. I come from a good family, so it‚Äôs not family related. Only thing I do is isolate myself from the entire world + my family by just staying in my room playing games and watching videos. I can‚Äôt do anything else. The only thing keeping me alive is my family. I cry or feel like crying whenever I picture them looking in horror at me taking my life.",0
"I‚Äôm obviously not. Depressed as I‚Äôll ever be, walking through life numb, detached, lonely, empty, feeling dejected, with no light at the end of the tunnel. Stop trying to fix me and give me cliche advice, because at the end of the day I‚Äôm still going to be depressed.",0
"I‚Äôve said my goodbyes. I think I‚Äôm ready and I broke up with my boyfriend, hopefully since he‚Äôll find out later and/or not at all or won‚Äôt hurt him. I just have no more energy left for the life I‚Äôm living.",0
"(Venting, throwaway account for privacy.) My mind is blank. I cannot think. I don't want to eat. I don't want to try anymore. I've been trying for almost 30 years now. It hasn't gotten better like everyone said it would. It's just been a series of ups and downs, a rollercoaster that never seems to end. I fucking hate it. My partner's grad program fucked us over with direct deposit again, so now all our bills are gonna be overdue. Again. We barely have food in the house, and neither of us have had the mental energy lately to cook what we do have. I could pick up more shifts to work all weekend for pennies to try and slowly pay a tiny bit of everything off, but I won't be able to make enough to pay everything. I'll work myself to the brink of death again just to barely get by, smoke to get through the day, and drink to fall asleep at night. Or I could just end it all. My partner knows I'm mentally ill and tries their best. They go above and beyond any efforts I've ever seen, including my own parents. I don't want to leave them behind. I feel so guilty for feeling this way. But I just can't keep going like this. I want this to be over. And there's no end in sight. So I should just make my own exit.",0
"I don‚Äôt feel like my life is not worth living at all. People tell me I have my life set since I‚Äôm only 16. But I just don‚Äôt know. School is confusing and I‚Äôm scared if I don‚Äôt pass and I‚Äôm not going to have my life set. Everyone gets mad at me in my family because I‚Äôm not a typical Mormon. I thought that life is something that you control, not life controlling you.",0
"Hello, I genuinely want to die. It‚Äôs been like this for months now (it somehow only grew worse), and I really thought antidepressants would magically cure me, but I haven‚Äôt been feeling much of a difference. I can‚Äôt kill myself because of the emotional toll it would have on my family, so if I can‚Äôt do that, what can I do? I think the next best thing is to commit ‚Äúemotional suicide‚Äù. Living each day being practically dead, yet somehow alive. I‚Äôve been trying so hard to get better, but every fibre of my being wants to die. If I lived each day being a zombie, with little to no emotions, I think it would be better than feeling constant dread. I don‚Äôt even know anymore, I just deeply loathe myself, but I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm even supposed to be at school right now, but I felt extremely shitty, and couldn‚Äôt even manage to muster up a shred of self-esteem to present myself at school.",0
"26 y/o male living in KC MO. Lost my package handler job in February for being too damn slow at it. Been living at my brother's apartment, but he's throwing me out since I can't make rent anymore. I have 3 dollars and some change, a ps4 and the phone I'm typing this with and that's it. I have nowhere to go. I have no friends whatsoever, and no family that will even give me the time of day. No degrees or certifications. My credit is terrible and I'm several grand in debt. I'm probably gonna spend my last $3 on a steel reserve so that killing myself doesn't hurt as much. Fuck this life. Fuck people. And fuck me for being such a useless piece of shit that never succeeded at anything in life.",1
"I feel horrible, but I don't have anyone to talk to. I can't tell anyone about how I feel, my friends abandoned me and nobody gives a crap about my feelings. I don't know what to do anymore. This pain is unbearable!",0
"I turn twenty-two soon and things are falling apart. I know I have it better than a lot of people‚Äî I have so much to be grateful for. I try to remember those things and keep them front and center. It‚Äôs a big year for me and there are so many due dates, deadlines and things to do‚Äî But I can hardly bring myself to get out of bed. I just don‚Äôt know what the point is, what the end goal is. I feel the only things really keeping me here is my sweet little cat and my mother. I just can‚Äôt shake this strange feeling that I am an outsider in everything I do and everywhere I go. I am tired of it and I just want it to stop. I feel guilty for existing. It‚Äôs like imposter syndrome but for being a person. I feel as though I don‚Äôt have the abilities needed to make my dreams come true, to be genuinely loved by someone, to be resilient enough to withstand the heartache I feel now and the heartache that is inevitably to come. I feel too old to still be self harming and feeling like a ghost. I feel like I don‚Äôt exist already, but somehow I‚Äôm still here. The existential dread is also unbearable and I don‚Äôt know how to lift this crushing weight in my chest. I just want to disappear completely.",0
"I feel pretty down every month or so, very down. I usually feel self hate and loneliness. I desperately crave feeling loved and cared about, and I have the urge to talk to people I'm close to, but all I end up doing is isolating myself, depriving myself of what I want, and then feel worse. It pushes people away. Does anyone else isolate themselves and bottle up what they are feeling? Anyone know why I do it? (Note: I have never seen a therapist and probably won't go either. I can't afford a therapist anyways)",1
"I feel like everything is just moving too fast, I‚Äôm about to graduate from high school and become a freshman in college. I lost a lot of friends and I just don‚Äôt care anymore. Everything is moving on so fast and it‚Äôs hard for me to take it in all at once. Friends coming and going like seasons. College applications, work, job it‚Äôs just hard. I barely talk to any of my friends anymore and I‚Äôve lost interest in many hobbies I once enjoyed like basketball, gaming, etc. does anyone else feel like this?",0
"I've had severe depression for pretty much my entire life, but that feeling has changed recently. There's now a constant weight in my chest as opposed to only sometimes. There's always a lump in my throat and I've been extremely dissociative. It feels like this round of depression will be my last.",0
"Man, holy fuck. I feel very neutral or passive right now. For the past 3 odd days I've just kind of been floating by. I've tried to kill myself twice in the past 5 months. Some people just aren't long for this world, and I truly, with all my being, believe that. I'm not cut out for this man. And it's paradoxical too because I think I have an objectively good life (outside of loneliness, my diagnoses of major depression disorder w/ suicidal ideations, complex PTSD, and anxiety). I have a truck, an apartment to myself, a cat, and a decently paying job (I'm surviving, ha). I just feel so goddamn lonely. All my irl friends I usually push away because I don't want to be bothered a lot of the time and I feel shameful telling them my mental problems. Fuck me man I am so tired. Just a heads up, I really don't want any of you to tell me why I shouldn't kill myself or my life has meaning and I'm loved. I don't like hearing that stuff.",0
"My bf lives on 9th floor I kinda want to jump out of the window. yes I know you little shit that youre stalking my posts and enjoy my suffering have a blask cause I may be dead soon. I cant take it anymore,I just wish everything would end",0
"I had a line cook job for two weeks after being unemployed for 9 months. They hired me at $14 an hour which is nice, though I wasnt any good at all. I tell them everyday how i suck or when food is sent back to be up cooked or refired i tell them sorry im retarded or sorry im actually useless and stupid. Today i no call no showed and bought beer and will drink myself to sleep tonight. They deserve a better cook one who doesnt suck and can move food through the window without upcooks. I feel bad that they payed me $14 hr when im clearly not good enough to make that much. Im gonna call n tell them tomorrow that they deserve better than what ive got to offer. I suck at everything i try which is why i sold all my video games and instruments. I just wish everyday that id never been put here on this rock to be so mediocre and useless. Im a fucking useless loser who will never amount to shit.",1
"My school always leaves the roof door unlocked and recently i‚Äôve been thinking and wondering if its high enough. I just can‚Äôt stand this life anymore because everything has been spiraling downhill like, me and my mom are on bad terms and she‚Äôs the only parental figure i have in my life. I also have very little connection to the world and in the end i‚Äôm just the root of everyone else‚Äôs problems. When my friends tell me they want to commit because of me i just say me too.Anyways, the only people i‚Äôd leave behind is the father i never knew. And plus my school is a hellhole so i feel it‚Äôd be best to go out where most of my problems started.",0
"Idk I'm really struggling with my emotions this last month or so, I get really angry over the dumbest things, just had a fist fight with my brother over a little arguement , severing ties with my friends over small things. starting to hear people whispering about me all the fucking time, and I just want to die all the fucking time, making stupid descisions and not caring about the consequences. And justifying it by saying I'll just die tommorow if I get caught. Help.",0
"I hate myself. i hate myself for being so selfish and lazy and shy and anxious and depressed. i wish i could be just like everybody else but it always feels so empty ya know. i dont wanna die, i want to live to be happy to not cry everyday o have friends to date and stuff but i dont know how and i feeli like i dont deserve do be happy or loved by anyone and it hurts, idk what to do anymore everyday is just so boring and sad and even when i have a good time i know it wont happen again so i just get sad and sadder everyday im afraid of everything and i know everyone's life would be better than me im just useless and i hate myself for not giving up of it all",1
"I see the brick walls where I used to see beauty. Eating no longer feels pleasurable. My hobbies make me agitated. My friends make me anxious. The only part of my brain that still works is the fear response. I‚Äôm not sure how much longer I can keep going. I grew up being taught to do the right thing‚Äîand I know continuing on is the right thing‚Äîbut I didn‚Äôt realize how much human sanity relied on positive emotions. We are not guided by instinct‚Äîwe are guided by these emotions. Mine are directing me towards death, and I wonder why, in the most advanced on minds, this pathway exists (suicide is unique to humans even though animals kill themselves). You know that feeling when you get your heartbroken? I feel that everyday, but I didn‚Äôt lose someone. I lost everyone and everything. I lost life.",0
"I have been crying for the whole morning. I could not take it anymore. I had a horrible nightmare about my life. It was telling me who was my real parent. I am an orphan and my adoptive parent never told me this. My dad and his family constantly biasd me and my mon when I was kid. They said we both poor and from uneducated family. We were filthy peasant. After my mom died he and his family told me to marry a rich man and didn't matter if I became a hidden wife, second wife of an old man. He told me I was different from normal girl I didnt deserve a good life. It was discovered two years ago that I was adopted. Neither my mom or my dad are my biological parent. And in my country it is a shame, an orphan usually treated very bad and deserved to be a maid. I had a nightmare about this and I remembered all my father told me and his family when I was kid. I could not take it anymore. I really want to die. I dont really have a purpose on my life. I dont know why I should life. I have my life and I hate myself.",1
"I‚Äôve noticed my younger brother (18) has been having some depressive thoughts. We live in different cities. I‚Äôm so glad that he‚Äôs able to be vulnerable with me and tell me when he‚Äôs feeling down, but I don‚Äôt know what to do next. I think I might be the only one in the family he‚Äôs talking to. Should I tell other? I don‚Äôt believeI should handle this myself but I‚Äôm not sure how everyone will react. Is it possible to be overbearing to someone who might be depressed and push them away? Would sharing make him lose trust in me?",0
"Post in question: https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/fdwfoq/yesssss/ Everyone always says diet/exercise/sleep...etc to help combat depression. However, over the years I have periodically thrown myself into all of those and when I do my depression gets worse. Like instead of just existing now I'm adding more work to my plate that I do not enjoy. Anyone else feel the same way when they try the common recommendations?",0
"I started my current job almost a year ago when I was in a really good place mentally. I've been really depressed before, and so I recognize the signs for me: first, anxiety and weightloss; then irritability, short-temperedness, and lots of suicidal thoughts. I know ""it gets better"", and I will get through this. However, the last time I was going through this I was still in college, but now I spend 8 hours a day for five days a week with the same people. I don't know how to keep this from affecting my work or my friendships/relationships with my coworkers and even my boss. Help!",0
"This keeps happening, i dont know if its my ptsd or anxiety or a panic attack but i start to think about everything and i begin to panic and i am hyperventilating and feel like im trapped and i dont know where to go or what to do, i want to find support for everything and i just dont know where to go i have no one and nothing in my life i feel so alone and so desperate im terrified Help Please",0
"People keep telling me that if I kill myself, then the depression will win the fight. Here‚Äôs the catch, they think I fucking care if it wins. I don‚Äôt give a shit anymore. I‚Äôm not even using a throwaway account because I don‚Äôt care about keeping it a secret. Why would I care if the depression wins? All I want is peace, and if it takes the depression winning over me to achieve that, then why should I care at all? I don‚Äôt. Idk why I‚Äôm even posting here. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm subconsciously looking for help, or just attention. Who knows. I don‚Äôt want to hurt my family, but at the same time I‚Äôm hurting them when I even tell them about my thoughts. I can‚Äôt fucking win anything anymore. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I am so goddamn pathetic it‚Äôs unbelievable. Sometimes I wish I was killed by a robber or shooter just so I didn‚Äôt have to worry about my family wondering what they did wrong.",1
"Every time I go home, I'll start to overthink. Then the feels would just all come attacking me. Staying at the office just lets me forget the things that haunts me. Sometimes I would just lay in the rest area for hours with a relaxed feeling and it would be the opposite when I get home. The only reason I go home is because I have to take care of the family. I even get good sleeps at the office than at home.",0
"I'm at the point where I'm fine with accidents that can happen, where it be I'm driving and a truck speeds and hits me, riding on train and exploding, walking on the sidewalk and hoping a car would hit me or I get snatched and be killed, walking alone late at night and some thugs beat me up. Heck if I had a sickness I wouldn't tell anyone and just die.",0
"So my depression is *very* treatment-resistant. I've lost track of how many different meds and med combos I've tried. Recently it was suggested that I try TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation), which has been proven to be effective for depression like mine. My psychiatrist referred me to the doctor who does it, but I've been putting off actually making the appointment because I'm scared. You know how sometimes people don't like taking meds because they make them feel like they're not themselves anymore; like they make them feel numb or empty? It's sort of like that, except in reverse. I've had my depression for well over a decade, more than half my life, and I literally can't imagine what it'd be like if it actually got better. Would I still feel like me? I know that things would improve, obviously, but change is scary, and in a bizarre way, my depression is comfortable. It's been a constant for most of my life and I don't know who I'd be without it. TL;DR- I'm scared to try something that could work because I don't know who I'd be without my depression.",0
"Ok so while this is definitely not my first time going to counseling, this was the first meeting with a new counsellor. It was set up through my work's EAP service, which I've used before with limited success. Anyway, I had my first session this week and it was weird. First of all, it was in a very unconventional location. It was in an office (I mean literally a room with a desk and some office chairs), inside an organization not typically known for mental health services. So that was weird and it took me a while to get comfortable enough to start talking. Since this was the first session, most of it was just me explaining what was going on in my life and why I'm there. Anyway, near the end she remarked that I was a fascinating person and she really wants to talk to me more. That's my first time hearing that, especially from a professional. Then she asked me if I was familiar with the mbti, to which I replied I am not a fan. She also suggested I check out metaphysics because it might help me or something. I Dunno , I walked out of there feeling strange. On one hand, the counselor was nice and all, but on the other hand, certain things made me a bit uncomfortable. Anybody else have any similar experiences? Should I stick with it or find someone else?",0
"If I down a bottle of sleeping pills and painkillers, would it take me?",0
"I explained my hurt and still got hurt, so I chose silence",0
Am I wasting my life? Everyday is the same. I only leave my house for work and sometime food. I get older and everything is the same. I‚Äôm 26 now but I feel more depressed than I did when I was 18. Will I ever get better? Does it stop or do I just waste away?,0
I've gotten back into burning myself. I deserve all of the pain. I'm a disgusting human being.,1
"i haven‚Äôt posted here in a while, been stressing over school, and my parents got me on meds, but nothing has really changed. i still hate every single thing about my body, idk wtf will happen to me in the future, and idek if i want to be a boy or a girl. so yea, i‚Äôm pretty much spiraling again.",1
"There are very few songs that strike a chord with my for being sad enough anymore? SO many songs are entirely about breakups and sadness surrounding that, but I'm not sad about that? I don't know if this makes any sense - but it almost feels like there isn't much music relatable to how low and depressed I am over life?",0
"My life, from an outside perspective, is objectively comfortable . I‚Äôm not terribly rich, but I have a roof over my head and food on my plate, with money to spare for my hobbies. I have a group of close supportive friends. I have depression. I‚Äôve had it on and off since I was 11, but it‚Äôs been consistently bad for the past year. Everyday is filled with excruciating pain and loneliness. But I often wish it was worse. I‚Äôm ashamed to admit that I sometimes wish my parents died all of a sudden or that my house will burn down or that I‚Äôll get in a bad accident so that I‚Äôll receive public sympathy. I‚Äôll FINALLY have something concrete to complain about! Because guess what? Right now, I *don‚Äôt* have much concrete things to complain about. At least not things I can tell people publicly. I guess another way to put it is that I‚Äôm desperate for attention, although I don‚Äôt like the connotation that comes with that phrase (as true as it may be). My head‚Äôs constantly battling these dark thoughts. My life is a living hell, and I‚Äôm frustrated that nobody‚Äôs taken notice, when it‚Äôs my own damn fault I‚Äôm not opening up to anybody. Man... I‚Äôm just so tired. I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can keep this up for. Everyday I think that this is the last straw. One of these days I‚Äôm going to collapse, but this time I won‚Äôt be able to get back up...",0
"I can't even do it right. Couldn't even fucking do it right. 5 hours in the hospital, they tell me to leave and I go back home, go to sleep and then get up to go to work. Back to all of this. I'm so sick of it. I'm so sick of it so sick of it so sick of it so sick of it. There's no point anymore. There's no point. Why can't it just be fucking over? I'm so tired. I don't want to do this anymore. I don't want to keep fighting. I just want to give up and rot. I'm tired. I'm so fucking tired.",0
I was in a mentally abusive relationship with a lot of cheating and even my dreams act out me getting revenge. How can I overcome these thoughts before I act upon them? Any advice would be helpful.,0
"Idk if this is the right place to express this concern. Recently i had a big fight with my bff we said a lot of bad things, in a month it will be his birthday and he is going to invite other friends of him and i am so afraid they will all hate me i mean i can‚Äôt blame it i am an awful person",1
"I love my mum, she‚Äôs my mum for gods sake, but when I went to do something, she saw I was on here. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs my fault for leaving my phone on the desk, but I‚Äôve tried all I can. My mums put me in therapy but that‚Äôs not helping at all. I just don‚Äôt want to seem like I‚Äôm not okay because, for the past month, everyone walks on egg shells with me. I want to die, I haven‚Äôt got a reason to live other than ruin my life. I‚Äôve been told that I matter but the words don‚Äôt mean anything when I‚Äôve been told that I‚Äôm worthless and should give up. I‚Äôve had to lie to my mum because I‚Äôve been close to suicide multiple times. I turn 18 this year as well so then I‚Äôll be out of the support of my parents. I feel lost. I want my mum to think I‚Äôm happy, yet, I‚Äôm so fucking suicidal I‚Äôve lost so many people. I might as well be dead if I keep pushing people away",0
I don't get why people want to me to live. I'm worthless and just don't want to be around anymore. I plan to try to hang myself again when I get home from work. Maybe this time I will get it right. I'm struggling with bills. No one loves me and I'm too scared to tell my therapist because I can't go inpatient again or I lose my job,0
"i went to inpatient a couple weeks ago after staying out of hospitals for about a year, and this time i cried because i felt like i could finally move on and it was ""over"". i recognize that i will still have to maintain my habits and medicine but it felt like i could do that, not giving a fuck about myself was over. I got released a couple of days after that and it all felt apart. i'm failing my classes, i'm single now, i don't have friends, i got into a fight with my sister and now we don't talk, and i feel like shit all the time and i cant talk to anyone about it because i have no one. i feel like the only option is to kill myself. this is a throw away account but i would like some help maybe? maybe some reason to live or a goal because i dont really have any.",0
"So depression sucks, it really does. The internal fighting of oneself, I‚Äôm just wanting it to stop. I‚Äôm not suicidal (this time) but other times it gets the better of me. This is the most candid I‚Äôve ever been. I use to type long monologues into the google search bar of how I would like life to end, that would be the closest I come to speaking about my internal sadness. I would delete it along with my search history as I would hate for someone to view it and be concerned. This is a ‚Äúthrowaway‚Äù account I guess, but my reason for posting is not to say I‚Äôm sick and about to end it, but I‚Äôm hoping there are ways to help it. I can‚Äôt do this ‚Äòtrain your brain‚Äô crap or self help books. I‚Äôve had numerous meds but lose sense of who I am. Is there a physical therapy, shock, sleep etc etc that can jolt you out of this mental rut? I have my vision on psychedelic therapies, those look promising. Any other possible helps?",0
"Whenever I am in bed trying to sleep, I always lay there for another 2-3 hours just trying to see how I got to the point where I am, it always ends with me feeling too bad to even think about anything anymore and I essentially cry myself to sleep.The lack of sleep caused my grades to plummet as I can never focus in class. Every day just makes me feel worse with everything around me slowly losing its meaning.",0
I'm 16 and I have had frequent thoughts about dieing and killing myself. I think of new ways of doing it like cutting and hanging and stuff and have cut my self a lot. I have had a rough childhood and recently something awful happened to me. I am lucky because I have supportive friends and family but I still feel empty and lonely. I might just do it soon...,0
"I've got my date set and all, but it can't come soon enough. I didn't anticipate looking forward to it, but I genuinely can't wait. When I first set it, I frequently became nauseous and dizzy thinking about my impending mortality, but as I get closer and closer to the day, the less worried and more ready I feel. It's becoming difficult not to discuss it with others or bring it up during conversations, especially because it's on my mind 24/7, it's the most remarkable thing that will happen to me probably ever. This probably sounds like an egotistical rant ""I, I, I, me, me, me"", but I do not care, for too long my life has been dictated by other people and factors out of my control and in my last 15 days, I'm gonna fucking focus on myself, nobody and nothing else matters to me now (when have I ever mattered to them?)",0
"I'm getting really bad grades in a class I used to be really good at. And in another class I'm being really disorganized losing sheets and not getting homework done on time. Truth is, Im exhausted from the moment I wake up so I'll just sleep when i get home, or I'll need to distract myself with a low effort activity rather than concentrate on homework to calm myself down from wanting to hurt myself. But I'm just lazy right? It's so frustrating being seen as careless when I'm just trying to survive. But my teachers expect me to get over myself because everyone goes through hard times. I'm already seeing a school counsellor who's not helping in any way and it's in secret because my parents wont let me see a proper therapist. Yesterday when I got 2 essays back I got E on both of them and I just wanted to tear my hair out because I'm trying so hard to balance everything out but it's not good enough. Seriously, all I can think about is killing myself and it's good enough that I actually come into school when I dont want anyone to see me because I feel too ugly, and I try to socialise with people and not zone out in class for like 8 hours. I just want everyone to know I have depression and help me out in any way but no. They dont give a shit. So I'll just fail and theyll never know why.",0
"So... I've wanted to kill myself for the longest. I've even made several failed attempts. I've prayed to God for death. For Him to take me in my sleep. And every morning after that, when I wake up, I cried because I still exist. I have grown to ultimately hate myself. I feel like the most trash ass human being... When I try to express this to other people, it will either be met with the ""tough love"" reprimand, or I end up pushing that person away because of my negative energy. I don't even know myself anymore. I don't have any more passion for things I once did (cooking, massage therapy). I attempt to develop motivation, but my depression and anxiety will team up with the PTSD I incurred from being robbed. When I notice negative self-talk, I'll try to change my thought patterns, but it always ends up back at ""The world would be better off if you were gone."" But I'm too much of a coward to try and take myself out again... I just want to be happy, man. I want to be who I was before I figured out I was raised in CPS, who I was before being orphaned, who I was before being the state's property and another statistic. Why the fuck am I still alive?",1
I have no one left not a single soul everybody texts calls md when they need something from me even then they dont ask how am i how am i doing they direct go to the stuff they need... I want to end it and ill prolly do it soon and as soon as i get the balls... If i never texted anybody or posted or anything ppl wouldnt know im alive.. Thats how it will be if i die nobody will know now ik its not bout that but isint it sad that even when you die u dont have anybody close enough to noticed... Im not worth anything idk why i was born i spent most of my life in hospitals anyway.. Never had nobody close to me i mean why would anybody be close w me... I had to pay money to fuck a whore thats an ugly way to put it but i didnt know how else to say it.. Eh why am i even writing here itll just ger burried in the posts... Ppl have it worse than me anyway.. Bye hope yall stay happy cause ill be happy once i leave this hell of a earth .,1
"I'm in my senior year and I have been depressed and suicidal for about 6 years.

I hear everybody talking about going to college, getting married, having kids in the future, and I will be dead. I stopped doing my school work because it doesn't matter anymore. The work is piling up and I feel so goddamn worthless. Everybody else is becoming so successful and I am becoming more of a failure. I am going to fail my senior year and become such a disapointment to my family. Nothing matters to me anymore. My parents think I'm going to college but I'm not. Fuck I'm in so much emotional pain and idk what to do anymore.",1
"I'm fucking tired of people telling that everything will be fine and I feel like they're the ones that are ill for not seeing how fucked up the world is. Just look at this sub, every few minutes someone desperately looks for help and tells how miserable he or she is, sometimes without even being noticed. Now think of how many of all suffering people don't even seek for help because nobody gives a fuck, that's the human nature. It's just that it hurts. Even if someone ""wants to help you"" it's just because he or she will feel as a better person and then will leave you like a trash that you are so why even bother looking for help? Maybe depression is just a name created by people who are too scared of what reality is like. What if depression is perceiving the world as it is, while having good mental health means to disctract oneself from others pain? Or maybe I'm just talking shit, I don't even know what is real at this point. Fuck everything.",0
Any chance anyone is up right now? i just cut and tried to take as many anti-depressant meds... could use someone right now,0
"Started college 10 yrs ago. Was going to graduate soon but haven't been able to keep up w/ school since Jan. Depression, anxiety + giving up, self sabotage, isolating from friends/family. Can't seem to do anything. Feeling helpless, no motivation, angry, no confidence. Therapy and meds not helping. Have let everyone down including myself. What should I do?",0
"I literally cba to do anything anymore. It's a constant pain in my chest and I really really wish the attempted OD would've worked but I was too fucking into crying to go find more pills it should've been enough. I really really want someone to genuinely care about how I feel. For them to ask hey hru unprovoked no one does that then everyone says when someone kills themselves 'hey I didn't know they were feeling like that' I wrote a note and I just want to do it but I can't but I want and I will. That's the only thing I'm motivated to do. Force myself to commit suicide. Literary nothing helps and I'm sick of trying and I understand others are in this situation but I can't really take this cause I'm too weak for it. Note: this is my suicide note, I don't know why I wrote it on Reddit I hope I come back one day and I'm able to say I didn't Kms but it doesn't seem likely right now I'm in a split of emotion. Edit: goodbye",0
"Of course everyone has a future, you can‚Äôt stop the future from happening. I mean my future is worthless, I have no plans except suicide at some point. no stability in my life whatsoever. I‚Äôm literally just waiting for death to occur whether its suicide or not.",0
"So I just talked to my parents today for the first time regarding that I want to get therapy. I just have a few questions (they may be hard to answer, so bare with me, I just want to know what to expect): 1) idk if this makes sense, but some of my typical depressive thoughts seem to not be as accessible when i'm in a better (not happy though) mood. this makes it harder to talk about the underlying issues. could this be a potential problem? 2) what do they typically ask you on the first appointment? 3) if i've been really narrow-minded and close-minded to a lot of people around me trying to tell me to think more positive and eat more, etc., is therapy really best for me? would therapy be helping me become less stubborn and more open-minded? 4) for those who have gone through therapy, was it relieving to finally have the official diagnosis? 5) again, for those who have gone through/are going through therapy, what's the biggest change you've seen in yourself? it can be good or bad. thanks in advance!",0
"It's the worst catalyst to depression. Period. Remember all your problems? Now they are amplified. They feel worse because you feel like you have an escape in love but you don't and you never will. You start fantasizing over and over about the ""salvation"" of your life, the only source of possible happiness that you can imagine, and the more time passes the worse it gets. It hurts and it ruins your head it's either suicide or find salvation in that person. I've never hurt this much over fucking fiction. This person as I know it is in my head. I am in love with a person I created, I don't even know this person, just her exterior, yet I feel like I'm close to this person and it hurts not imagining a fake relationship. It hurts so fucking bad it feels good to think abandoning this world. No regrets. Why? I am doing a favor to my crush and myself. Yet it still hurts I can't fall asleep. How does this make any sense? How strong is fictional love? Who is making me feel like this? I want to escape this hell. I already have crippling thoughts about my future and this just keeps coming up to me and it's so bad. So so bad. I feel like I'm one step from being pulled into the underworld away from everything, where I will be the king of my lonely world.",0
"The only time I don't have to think about my shitty life is when I'm sleeping, I spend the whole day and week depressed, my only escape from my depression are my novels and YouTube, otherwise I'd be waiting for the weekend to come so I can drink my ass off and think about death, I know this is all my fault, sometimes I have thoughts about changing to the better and actually getting a hold of my life, be committed and face the reality, but things are already too messed up for me to control them, turns out it's true ; the more you ignore your problema the worse they get",0
"My dad committed suicide when I was 12. I played a role in his suicide. My narcissistic mother told me many lies about him and convinced me to hate him. When I became alienated from him, he committed suicide. I‚Äôm now 23 and I see no reason to continue living. I hope to join him soon. If there is such thing as an afterlife, I want to tell him I love him.",0
"I can't see myself dying any other way. I've been trying hard to actually be a functioning adult, but the more I try, the more I fuck up, and the less I function. Everyone irl's advice is to just do it because it's life. Good for you. But I'm not meant to survive. I am literally not built to make it through life. My brain tried. It tried its best to block everything out. To make sure I didn't feel anything that would cause me to shut down. But unfortunately emotions build. I was fucking doomed from the start.",0
"I feel like my life is spiraling downwards getting worse each day. My dad has ALS, my mom is stressed out to the max taking care of a husband who is a selfish unappreciative jack wagon. I have to deal with a bullish, vindictive shithead for a manager that makes me dream of breaking his kneecaps inward, no friends, no woman, no life. My faith is growing dimmer by the day because of asshats who ride in on a hypocritical high horse. My doc says with my depression, anxiety, and high blood pressure, I wont live to see 35. Most nights, virtually every night, I go to bed a bit more angry, a bit more suicidal, and hoping, praying to a god who couldn't give a rat's ass about me to either give me cancer or do not allow me to wake up. My only vent is either here, where we all fight enough of our own battles to not worry about anyone else's (I'm not blaming anyone) or smoking black and milds. That's my vent for the evening.",0
"I [m23] am probably one or two bad days away from just giving up. Im in school, taking classes to qualify for my dream program which would qualify me for my dream job. I have a girlfriend. I have a great family. But I'm not sure i have it in me do put up with the school and the problems with my relationship and dealing with my own mental health issues anymore. Im struggling with depression and anxiety and ADHD symptoms, but the therapist that was supposed to refer me to a doctor to see about medicine hasnt done that yet. Its been almost two weeks and he hasnt returned calls or taken any steps at all to get me that medicine evaluation. I am not enough for my girlfriend. Not romantic enough. Not sexual enough. Not thoughtful enough. I have tried for years to change that, she's been through all of it, but i haven't changed a bit. Maybe the medication would help, but i cant seem to be able to get it. I struggle to learn in class, i struggle to improve in my relationship, and every day i find it more enticing to just fall back on my bachelors degree that i already have and work in an office or something. Sure, i know i wont be happy. But im not happy now, so whats the difference? At least i wouldnt have to put any more effort in than i have to. I just want to give up. I have nothing left in me. The only thing keeping me going is that i dont want to disappoint my parents or my girlfriend anymore",0
"Hi, As the title suggests, where to go or how to help yourself where my options are severely limited? My GP can only organise pills for me. I have no way of acquiring a therapist. I have been severely depressed for past couple of weeks and mildly since about November. I don't have a trusted parent, sibling or a friend that I could open up to. I tried a while ago but I ask to support me in functioning day to day, pushing me to work and they just tell me they're sorry or they wish they could help. You know, the empty ""You can talk to me, it will get better"". Then they cut contact. My boyfriend just says he doesn't know how to help me and has phases of randomly complimenting me or texting me to tell me he loves me for two days straight then he forgets all about it. I'm sure he tries his best but I just wish I had more support and he says ""he can't help me anymore than he does"" everytime. I feel so trapped. I always have to pretend I'm fine. I always cover up with humor. It seems like I'm insincere or dramatic when I finally snap and just say I'm a mess. I can't afford a therapist. My university counselling office won't help me. They offered a suicide hotline numbers (?) and ""we're sorry but this isn't a psychological support that we do here"". How to cope? Where to go? Edit: Please don't advertise religion/cults to me. I'm not interested and heavily despise brainwash without any real therapeutical value.",0
"Hi, Im 19. I have absolutely nothing. I lost the girl i loved. Im addicted to weed and a dozen other substances (whatever i have and makes me sleep a night). Im in huge debt. I dont have a job. I dont have any degrees and no future. Im the black sheep of the family and they'd rather wish i wasnt born. I live in my own cuz my mom and dad kick me out. They are divorced so yes i was kick out twice. I try to be a nice guy but every one hates me and so do i. I don‚Äôt want to go on but i just cant get myself to do it. Anyone feel the same?",1

"Hey. 16M here. I‚Äôm just a wee little high schooler but I feel like I‚Äôve been through a whole ass war with my own fucking brain. For context, my depression got intense at around 7th-9th grade. Finally it‚Äôs started to slow down and I don‚Äôt want to kill myself as much as I did in middle school. But not everything‚Äôs is so hunky dory. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm alone on this and I doubt I am, but it‚Äôs so hard to get motivated to do anything but play video games and smoke weed. Now I know I‚Äôll probably be told that the weed isn‚Äôt helping with my motivation, which it isn‚Äôt, but that isn‚Äôt the issue. My issue is that I don‚Äôt have any drive to want to better myself or to do anything other than what is fun to me. Am I alone here? Is this because of something other than my depression? I never do homework, I never study, and these days it‚Äôs actually affecting all of my grades and that kills me because I could get away with doing *some* of my homework and get amazing grades on tests and 9 times out of 10 I‚Äôd pass with a C or above. But now I‚Äôm getting Fs in my classes and I just want to quit. I can‚Äôt find a reason to continue being in this useless place we call school for my ‚Äúeducation‚Äù. Anyway, you probably have something better to do than to talk to me so, I‚Äôd better get back to ‚Äúwork‚Äù.",0
"Over the years, I've been called lazy for wanting to lie in bed, a baby for breaking down and crying, and selfish for wanting any time to myself. When they suspected that I was doing bad things to myself, I was also told that I would burn in hell for it. I was diagnosed with depression, and even the doctor didn't really seem to care. So I guess I don't either. I don't take care of myself as much as I should because I'm losing my will to change. To be better. I'm starting to think that I really am just as useless as my family thinks I am.",1
Life is a fucking nightmare. Having children is beyond selfish and ignorant. My parents deserve no sympathy. I will kill myself regardless of their feelings.,0
"I went to a school counselor to talk about some recent &gt;!sexual!&lt; trauma and general ill feelings and I left there feeling worse about myself. I haven‚Äôt been to therapy since 2014, and it was mostly for dealing with depression symptoms. Therapy helped me tremendously, and I felt better talking with complete transparency about my baggage with someone equipped to handle it. I went back recently and the interaction boiled down to them telling me 1) I was medicated at too young of an age (started SSRIs very young) and therefore my parents raised me incorrectly, and 2) Skepticism that the therapy ever helped me. He literally asked me, ‚Äúdid that even help if you stopped going?‚Äù He told me his background was in social service, and he recorded the session for the school‚Äôs records. He also told me that after this preliminary session he would refer me to a person with the proper training, but after our session ultimately decided he would take me on for appointments ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt normally do this, but scheduling is too hard right now‚Äù I'm moving to a new city soon, so I really feel scared about how I'm going to support myself. As someone who's generally self-sufficient this was sort of a heavy blow, since I really need someone to talk to.",1

"Hey, I've struggled hard with depression and I'm currently grieving a suicide of a loved one. Not feeling too great at the moment. I'm offering a song to any of you who want one. I will write and record a song about you or about any topic you would like. It will be free and with the hopes that it makes your life a little bit better, even just for a moment. I'm a musician and I love writing songs about other people. About 4 years ago I wrote 30-40 songs for people on reddit and it went really well.

"My heart is screaming, my soul (and my right arm due to self harm) is bleeding and burning, I am feeling lower and lower each day that passes, I feel more and more like I will explode, several personnal reasons caused me to feel this way (sexual bias, poverty, loneliness, studies, ill relatives, I am also possibly underdiagnosed when it comes to my mental health) but I don't know how to ask for help. I don't know what to say, and I would feel guilty saying this to the people around me because I will bother them. I told it to my best friend but she is suicidal and severely depressed and she started to self harm again after I told her I self harmed and I don't want to make her feel worse. I want to support her although I don't have the strength to do that. I told it to a friend and to my sister as well and although they are helping and kind, I don't want to tell them how bad I feel. I don't know how to. I tried to see psychologist but I have to wait untill at least april. This is a free psychologist and I can't afford to see another one earlier if it means I have to pay. My credit card has been stolen anyway lol. Anyway, my way of coping with all of this is to put myself in danger and make myself feel physically bad in the hope I will feel more valid in my suffering and that I will finally be able to ask for help and feel like I deserve it.

"So when your child's suicidal, self-harming, chronically depressed, and suffering bias while you're away from the house, the obvious solution is to tell her that she's lying about everything and just needs to study harder because grades = good degree = good job = no more depresso. &amp;#x200B; Wow.

"It will get better for you, the person with more than a handful of friends worried for you and asking if you'll be okay, the person who actually has a significant other who you can always turn to, the person who has a community that accepts them and doesn't discriminate against them for their entire identity. The person who only has depression and not a literal learning disability that impacts how you interact with others, and they treat you horribly because of it.

"I‚Äôm convinced that antidepressants don‚Äôt do shit. I‚Äôve been on bupropion, sertraline, risperidone and citalopram. None of them feel like they do anything. From the day I started taking them, I never felt the slightest effect. No dizziness, sleepiness, wooziness, grogginess, horniness, happiness, sadness, gassiness or any other ness. Nothing to indicate that they work. They‚Äôre placebos meant to trick people into thinking they‚Äôre working.",0

And my parents tell me im not allowed to tell a doctor, because the intrusive thoughts could endanger my planned out medical career. Life has become too much to bear and i cant take it. Ive become so stressed my eye has started to twitch almost every time i blink. I cant escape, and not even suicide is an answer anymore. It doesnt help that it feels like everyone god damn hates me. Any mistake i make, i always have a thought like ""wow, that person probably hates me now"" and i cant live with my own thoughts. When ever i dont have a distraction, my mind starts saying violent stuff i dint agree with, but it says it in my voice, making me think im fucking crazy. Maybe i am fucking crazy.

"I've felt this way for a very long time. The feeling of inadequacy, the contempt of others, the anger, and the overwhelming loneliness. For such a long time, I've kept it bottled up, but now its beginning to boil over and I don't know how to handle it. This is my first time admitting to this and I think its easier to admit in anonymity than to my family. They wouldn't understand these feelings and I inevitably chase all of my friends away. I have no hobbies or anything that I am good at so I just wallow in my sadness. I dont want to be so absorbed in my own issues but its hard to overlook when it begins to bleed over into the things I used to care about like school. Being alive has never been a feeling that I can remember feeling happy about.I've come to live with pain and failure but I would just like the feeling to stop and feel even a modicum of ""okay-ness."" Despite everything, I cant say I'm better off and I simply do not want to deal with any of it anymore to be honest. I really want to get better and i hope that this is the first step to that for fear of the alternative.",0
"There's this thing that circles around my feed every once in a while, about how Eeyore is feeling low so he stays at his house instead of going out with Pooh and Piglet, so Pooh and Piglet go to his house, where Eeyore says he's not been hanging around with them because he's sad and low and not much fun to be around. So then Pooh and Piglet sit next to Eeyore and don't say anything, they just lend him their presence, with love and without judgment. And then, although he doesn't feel better, he \*does\* feel better. I've got people like that, people who have straight up offered just to sit with me, who don't care how low I am or how un-fun I am to be with, they just love me. But the thing is, the thought of having someone just sit with me while I am dying inside -- I mean, I seriously can't even bear it. As much as I would be willing to do that for someone else, I simply cannot accept being on the receiving end of it. What is that?

For a while I thought I was lazy, but I'm quite a rational person, and even when I've made full sense of why I should get up and do a thing, I recede into doing nothing again.

I don't want to wake up, I don't want to be anywhere or with anyone, and I don't even want to sleep anymore and that's the only thing that would numb my depression (because I wasn't awake to feel it).

Everything's just so dark and honestly I could go on forever but my brother-in-law just walked in and I have to pretend like I'm okay again so I guess I'll stop there.

I even did a performative thing with a belt around my neck. Turns tour it slips out of the doorjamb. I know how to tie a noose and a couple kinds of slipknot.

My son gets very angry with me. He thinks I choose to be/feel this way and says ""just stop being sad be happy how easy is that?!"" I know I cannot be upset with him for not understanding, but I'm also extremely frustrated about it. He says it's embarrassing to have a mom with depression. That just hurts me even more. He went from having a happy, energetic, spunky, fun, thrill seeking, supportive mom to one who lays in bed all the time, is constantly fatigued, has migraines constantly, no patience, never wants to do anything, cries a lot, etc. I feel like he's grieving me. I grieve myself, so I can understand. But he cannot. He thinks I'm just being selfish, lazy, mean, etc. I looked on Google for some ideas but didn't find anything that I felt like going with. I've tried many times to explain it from my perspective, but he just cannot comprehend what I'm saying. I'm lost, and it's making me feel even worse.

I want to know if there's any other ways of solving this because I'm aware of how final suicide is but I know if I try talking to someone about this in real life I will just say things to be considered fine so I don't have to cost my parents money for therapy.

"Over the course of my life, I have attempted suicide four times. Each time, I was hospitalized, and each time I've tried again. The last times, it failed because someone found and stopped me. My ex boyfriend commit suicide last year. I have difficulty making plans due to a mild obsessive compulsive disorder, and just finding time. I have a heart condition that has been steadily worsening after a miscarriage, and due to it, I can't hold down a regular job and have since resorted to online work that pays like shit. I'm homeless. I have only two people in any sort of position to provide support, emotionally.

My family is going on vacation soon. I wasn't invited. That week, I can complete the steps the way I planned, if I want to.

Meditation and such seems to point me in this direction. Tarot readings, horoscopes, all of it seems to be dropping hints that this is it. The main difference between all the times before, is that this time, I have nothing left to be afraid of. We can't forgive ourselves for all the things we did not become.",0
"I made a rope noose, I wrote an email to my parents about how much I love them and how I didn't want to do it but I just can't go on, and scheduled it to be sent in twelve hours. I just cannot go on please someone help me. I have been trying to find a way out but dying seems to be the only option. I'm not successful in anything, classes, money, friends, love, life in general. I am thinking of all possible futures that I can go from this point, starting by being this unsuccessful, and none of the scenarios make me happy. I just cannot live one of those miserable lives. I don't know what to do, my parents love me so much it will destroy them. I wish I could just suck it up for them and keep going but everything hurts so fucking much, I don't think I can do this any longer. I don't even know what I'm expecting out of this, there's not a single thing that can help me now. I thought of every possible thing, there's not a single way out. Please what the fuck do I do now?",1
Now at lunch the only person that didn't have an activity planned with the school(just like me) left class leaving me alone again :) :). I love being worthless XD XD XD,1
"I've always struggled with depression, but I am at the lowest I've felt in a long time, I've pushed most of my friends and boyfriend away, family hardly talks to me. On top of it, my biggest stressor, I am drowning in debt, I am unable to find better employment, I live in a rural part of California without transportation, housing is scarce and expensive. My rent was just raised and I don't know how I am going to afford it.. I don't have family to turn to financially. My parents are well into their 70s, enjoying the end of their lives, and my brother is a drug dealer. On top of that my brother lives 5 hours away and my parents two states.. I survived a car accident in December of 2018. It left me carless and in a mountain of debt, on top of my other debts. The debt, the fact I can't seem to save or get ahead, I have no one to turn to, I am not really conventionally attractive either.. I just feel lost, depressed, numb, want the stress to go away, even for a moment. I miss my best friend (passed away just a few months ago, not sure if it was intentional or not but it was definitely an overdose, I was mad at him at the time and pushed him away and encouraged his binging.) The only thing still keeping me here is that I would feel guilty if my dog was left alone for days before my body could be found, and I don't want her to end up in the wrong hands.",0
"I say I feel tired. He says ""You're always tired."" I say that I don't deserve to be here. My friends try to convince me that I do, say that I'm too hard on myself. I'm starting to repeat myself though. I tell my counselor about my suicidal thoughts, but I can't explain why they're here or what they're like. I just feel like I want to be in bed all the time. I wish I could bury myself in blankets and curl up into a ball. But even that's not small enough to describe how small I want to be. Unnoticed. Maybe that's enough of a description.",0
"a while ago i realised i might have muscular dystrophy, which means i am going to have a slow and depressing death. not too long from now i wont be able to walk, i'm going to loose my favoured hand. because of this i fell off on my school work last semester and failed more than half of my modules which means my sponsor cutting me off, but i cant afford to pay on my own. i haven't told my single mother yet and this is stressing me out and now am seriously considering suicide",0
"Go out, too out of your mind with sleep deprivation to be coherent, sit around at home feeling like shit in all respects, have both of your parents dismiss that anything's wrong while pouring gas on the fire by being passive aggressive every time they interact with you, and when it seems like things might change, whether it's your own efforts or the environment just shifting, it all circles back to being the same again. The ride never ends.",0
I think every night I wish I wouldn‚Äôt wake up. I thought the divorce would help the feelings. I thought therapy would help. I thought pills would help. But everyday is sad and all consuming. I can‚Äôt think about anything other than my situation or killing myself often at the same time. I‚Äôm so tired of the next day coming. Finding myself praying to find the courage to do it vs the courage to not do it. Today isn‚Äôt the day for me but it feels inevitable.,0
"Well, my title says it all. If I had a choice, I would sleep and hang out all day by myself. I have a cousin in town who wanted to meet me at a local art expo and I made up an excuse as to why I cannot meet him for lunch. I can tell he was disappointed and I feel lousy about it. My mom passed away 6 months ago (cancer), my dad lives in a memory care facility (dementia), I got divorced in September and I am estranged from my crazy brother (for good reason). Anyway, I‚Äôm just...not in the mood to make small talk, talk about my deceased mother and walk around an art show. I feel like a terrible person for not being able to meet these social obligations. Am I terrible? Anyone else feel similarly? Help, please.",1
I have been dating my bf for about 4 months so the relationship is fairly new. Yesterday we were supposed to hangout but he stood me up and texted at 11pm saying he overslept. He told me that we needed to talk about something tomorrow and when I asked if he could give me a topic just so I am not so worried he said it was about his depression. We have never discussed depression before however my ex also struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts throughout our 3yr relationship. I always did my best to be loving and supportive to my ex but I also felt like I didn‚Äôt know the best things to say. I have also gone through my own low points but always when I was single and extremely alone without friends or supportive family. People with depression: is there anything your significant others have said that made you feel like they understood you and had your back? Anything you wish they had said to you?,0
"Home life is really bad at the moment, both parents are alcoholics and recently their drinking had been getting a lot worse. It's cause both sides of my family to argue due to my parents lack of care over my younger sister. I want to move out but I do not have the money, I don't really have anywhere to go, I want to call social services on my parents (again) but I can't as I'll be kicked out and have my belongings potentially trashed. My parents have never been there for me, I didn't have the best childhood, which has caused me to have an unfortunate array of mental disorders and depression. But now I'm starting to think I'll win the lottery of 1 million and everything will be okay, I keep thinking I'm going to win money and then I can move out and give me and my sister a better life for both of us. It's getting to the point that I'm daydreaming constantly of winning a large sum of money, and that I can get my own place and my sister will be okay. Ive started to genuinely think I'm a millionare. I'm that depressed I'm having unrealistic dreams and thoughts of the future so I don't think of what's happening at home and I don't know what to do. I don't get a lot of money to my self, I cannot get a job due to health/mental health reasons, even though I'd like to work. Everything is getting worse again and it feels like my brain is struggling on ways to cope with it.",0

"Feeling this way isn't a bad thing. Something that is said to much in our society is that feeling suicidal if a bad thing. The whole ""don't do it,"" line is just a rewording of our society sentiment towards suicide. You should just know that feeling suicidal, even to the point of writing notes and making plans isn't a bad thing. There is no shame in falling when you've been beaten. Feeling suicidal is a perfectly natural response to bias, depression, psychosis, or any other horrible thing; you can't go near a fire without getting hot. There is nothing wrong with you for feeling suicidal, for feeling like you hate yourself. Maybe the reason you hate yourself is because you've never been loved, so you see no proof that you are worthy of any. Maybe it's because you have been biasdv so thoroughly you've been programmed to hate yourself. No matter the cause, I cannot stress this enough, it is not a bad thing. The bad thing is whatever caused you to feel this way",1
"When I was 15-16 years old, I posted here in my darkest moments. I couldn't see any reason to keep living. I thought I was nothing special and the next 8 years seemed like an endless slog. You can look through my post history if you want. Since then, I graduated college and graduate school. I have traveled the world. I swam with bioluminescent algae in Indonesia. I've hiked among alpacas in Peru. I learned to speak Spanish fluently and connected with people around the world and in my own country, who speak Spanish too. I've published my writing i multiple publications. I have fallen in love and had my heart broken several times. I realized I'm gay, came out, and I'm with the most amazing woman. I have a career that I love where I help people every day. I can honestly say that depression may be a lifelong struggle for me, but it is possible to recover and develop tools to cope with it. Every day is a manageable challenge now. Every day I am grateful to just be alive. I am SO GLAD that I didn't kill myself 8 years ago. I never would have known how beautiful my life could become. Before you think about killing yourself, remember that you don't know how beautiful your life could become. How could you? You have no way of knowing until you get there. But you need to be alive.",0
"Sometimes life can be too much. We can often feel like sharing how depressed we are is being burdensome to those we love but all of the people who care about you, would much rather hear about how unwell you've been feeling instead of seeing you crack or break down or have to go to your funeral. It may not be comfortable but we have to be bold in our sharing with our friends because at the end of the day our people are all we have. Please, if you need to talk, dont keep it in. Find someone to talk to.",0
"Had a birthday, I am 22 now. I still live with my parents. Got kicked out of my state university and am at community college now for the second year. Take maybe 1-2 classes a semester (anymore and I‚Äôll be overwhelmed). Work about 10 hours per week at a data entry job my parents work at. Still come home and put off doing any homework or studying so I can play video games. Skip class a lot. Watch the same few shows over and over. Don‚Äôt have a concrete idea for my future or what I‚Äôm going to do with it. Still laugh at humor I found funny when I was in my teens. Lie to all my old friends (haven‚Äôt made a single new one in college, all friends are from high school or before) about how my life is going. Don‚Äôt exercise often (genetics allow me to still be skinny, expect for my face which accumulates fat beneath my chin. Not a good look.) Self conscious about how skinny I am and never wear short sleeves in the summer. Social anxiety about my appearance. What is wrong with me??

"Idk guys my life sucks. I mean i have more than the most people have, but it seems like my life just gives me shit. I try to be positive about the most things but it doesnt help at all. I even did lsd for like 4 times now. And every time i used like 3 hours just for thinking about my life and the things that make me happy. It helped me. I know what i want in life. I dont care about cars and money. I just want a Family with a wife that loves me. But with that Knowledge comes the fear that i wont archive those things. Idk i feel so alone at the moment. So fucking alone that i made a reddit post just to express my feelings. Idk i guess im gonna smoke weed and drink myself to sleep tonight. I hope you guys are fine. And remember mom would be sad..",0
"So I think about death all the time and regularly think about situations where I get hit by like a bus or have terminal cancer, it's so bizarre. Because I'm not actually a risk to myself, I'm not in any way planning any attempt but as I fall asleep it seems like I'm always thinking about how an exit wound would look at the back of my head. I call passive suicidality 'living in the Grey'. It's an inbetween state, smack bang in the middle of loving life and hating it. It's so strange because health professionals are always asking if I'm having 'dark thoughts' and it's like, well, what really *is* a dark thought? When it comes down to it, it's the behaviour, the intention, not the thoughts, that are the true issue. Death is always on my mind. Not just my own, but anyone and everyone. I think constantly about different situations where people in my life die tragically, and how I would grieve. Would I crumple into a depressed mess or rise to the occasion and be strong for the rest of my family? Who would care if I died? So many questions all the time. Anyone else constantly have death on the brain?",0
"I posted it here and people didn't believe me back then, I cared about it before but I don't care anymore. I'm serving in the military and I feel shit about it. I feel broken inside, I changed in a very bad way. I started having brake-downs and even wetting the bed. I feel embarrassed, ashamed, and the worse part is that I still have 2 years left (I served 1 year so far). I haven't told anyone about wetting the bed as I'm not 4 years old. And frankly speaking I just don't want to think about it. I'm thinking about just ending it sometimes... But I don't want to cause my family and friends any unnecessary sorrow. I hate it. I hate myself. I hate my life. If you read so far, thank you.",1
"I‚Äôve been struggling with depression, S H since before my teen years and just started to barely get hold of myself. Like just today morning my brain was like, ‚ÄúLIFE IS MEANINGLESS! I WANT TO DIE! LET‚ÄôS DO IT AGAIN! WRIST THEN FOREARM BECAUSE WE‚ÄôRE DOOMED!!!!!‚Äù And I was like, ‚ÄúBAD BRAIN!!!!!‚Äù Then I realise: Even if the situations triggering you are no longer present, even if everything is running smooth by others standards, your brain still relies on its default thought pattern. The only thing one could do is to bypass these thought patterns until it becomes the default. Therapy finally made sense.",0
"I‚Äôve changed so much since I‚Äôve gotten depression, I stop caring about school my relationships with my friend, I stopped caring what peaple think about me (witch can cause me to an asshole) before depression I thought I wouldn‚Äôt even touch alcohol and now I‚Äôm starving to do shrooms (don‚Äôt drink that much) I used to get decent grade and try now I‚Äôm just passing bc my teacher are rounding up my makes to 50, I‚Äôve recently stopped cutting but only bc I have nothing to do it with and my gf doesn‚Äôt want me to.

"Goodbye I wish things could have gone differently, I hate every second of life. I hate every thought that I have, every breathe that I take and every piece of my life. I don‚Äôt want to suffer for the rest of my life, but I also don‚Äôt want others to suffer for my ‚Äúselfish‚Äù choice. I hated growing up, biasd, everyday insults for something that I didnt do. I hated going home and then going back to school feeling different and separated from everyone else. I rushed life, I didnt do anything important growing up, I had amazing friends that I love and who also are the reason that I‚Äôm still here. I was always told that I didnt know anything, and maybe I don‚Äôt, maybe this is a foolish choice, maybe theres a hell. I feel like my life is just going into a dead end. I hate college I dont even know what I want to do with my life, I feel like im wasting my time, but at the same time I feel like Im learning more about my self but why the fuck is it so hard? I have a chance to go the campus therapist, but for some reason i keep hesitating to call, its like I need someone to push me, but theres not going to be anyone, its just me alone in my dorm room. I just dont want to live anymore. I feel like Im worthless, I have zero value, I need someone. I feel almost like i‚Äôm only living for others..",0
I just don‚Äôt have feelings of happiness or feel good anymore. Everyday just feels like a cloudy dream over and over again. I used to have such a zest for life and over the last 3-4 years it has completely disappeared. I can‚Äôt go on living and feeling like this on a daily basis.,0

"I feel like people don't understand the fact that being suicidal is not all about ""wanting to die"". I don't want to die, I just want the pain I'm causing to myself and those around me by being a burden to end and dying seems like the most relevant solution as most of the other stuff I have tried has failed. I think that's why I oversleep a lot, that way I'm not really living, its like temporary death, death without commitment. I don't even know what I'm talking about I guess I just want the pain to end.",0
I don't know what I want to do in the future because I just don't want to experience anything of it. It has always been like that. I feel like as if we live in a big factory. We are used until we break. We are numbers and treated as if we are worth nothing. It makes me sick. I want to escape it but there is literally no safe place on this planet. I don't have any plans because I don't want to be a part of this cruel machine any longer. Do you have difficulties making future plans because you don't really see a future for yourself? Can you relate in some way? What is your reason?,0
"Everything i did to get out of depression and being suicidal backfired.... here's everything i tried. 1: i have tried being useful,i got a job, as a car mechanic, just to help people, but i somehow broke my arm... i quit that job... and didn't get accepted to any other jobs 2: i tried to find love, it was not really succesful.... i do get contacted by people, but its never to hear how im doing, or anything alse, i always get contacted by people when they need help, making me feel used... that stopped though, all becouse of: 3:i tried making myself happy by making others happy,and it worked! For two weeks. becouse surprise! I got used again, i talked to people that i tought of as my friends, but it all backfired, fell in on itsef, and made me look like an asshole who tries to make everyone fight.

"Posted on this /r/sexuality and I want to post it here since this subreddit is more active. -- I am a male and I'm 19, I go to college. I have never been happy and content in my life, severe depression that's been on for 4+ years is one of the root causes. Depressed because I have no intimate interactions with females, who I am absolutely attracted to. Three ago I started experiencing thoughts that I would truly find happiness if I were born a female and I don't really know how I find solute in that thought - maybe because of my limited experience with women, but I do not know for sure. I lost my virginity after two days of my 18th birthday to a hooker and I didn't even get to finish. I've only hooked up with one girl when I was 17 and that included only making out and that was it, apart from those two experiences I have other sexual experience whatsoever. I need some help to understand my own self and why I feel this way, maybe it's because I need to get more experience with women? (Which is another problem.) Reddit please help",0
"I mean, I'm not hating on people who celebrate it, it's just not my thing personally. To me it's just a new year. There will be plenty of them in the future. A lot of people will dislike 2018 in the same way they've disliked almost every year before it.",0
"I really want to stop myself from watching porn.. I'm a 19 years old girl, never been with a guy, only with a woman. I consider myself bisexual.

During nights when I was young I always hear my Mother and Father having sex, worst even if I'm sleeping beside them. Sometimes, I think it is a make up sex that theyre are doing.. When I was young, I really had a thing with older men. Ive been groped a lot of times.. and the worst thing is that I actually enjoy it. It made me feel arouse when someone is groping me and I dont know why. That's why in porn, I'm being aroused as well with groping or.. force or worst gang sex whatever they call that. I used to masturbate and still masturbating for it. I dont know why am I so into it even if I know that porn industry is evil and I dont ever want to be raped. I dont want casual sex as well.. but still I find myself masturbating to it and being so aroused by it. That's one of the things that depressing me. I want to stop myself from masturbating, I want to stop myself from watching porn.. thing is now, I'm on a long distance relationship and she's into kinky stuff.. i just dont know what to do anymore I just want to end everything..

"I am currently in my friend's restroom breaking down for the last ~30 minutes. Aplogies for the wall of text. In the eyes of many, I am sure my life is fine. I am moderately attractive with a relatively outgoing personality and decent intelligence. I get lucky with some thing and have the best friend group someone could ask for. Yet despite all this, I still am overwhelemed with depression. To preface, my depression is sometimes caused by outlying causes, but mostly seems to manifest randomly whenever it wants to. I graduated in 2010 with high expectations from my folks. Nothing too crazy, but significantly better than I performed. With depression and anxiety, I have skipped on many of the opportunities in life (fun, women, careers, etc) and can't seem to truly overcome it entirely. I trick myself into believing it is gone for periods of time, but it inevitably comes back harder than the times previous. I now am sitting in 2018 having accomplished little outside of making a good friend group, and while having gone into business with a close friend, feel like I am the weak partner. Ultimately my whole life feels like I squandered it and wasted myself when others could've capitalized and lived a happy, fruitful life while my depression and anxiety rules who I am to this day. Frankly, I don't feel deserving of the opportunities I have recieved, regardless of any good I have done. I know it's stupid for someone in my situation to feel this way with so much good in life compared to most others in this subreddit and elsewhere, so i'm sorry. Hope you all have a good year.",1

Well tonight I did it and cannot believe how understanding she was. Turns out depression runs in the family and she's been secretly seeing someone for years!

"Happy New Year everybody. I've been on Reddit for a while but didn't know this place existed. I've had depression for a few years, but in my case, my depression comes and goes. So I can feel horrible for a whole month but after feel like I'm on top of the world for a bit. One of the sad realizations of 2017 for me is realizing that there are a lot more people who suffer from depression than I thought. I'm starting to build a good support group of friends and family when things get tough, but I haven't felt there are too many groups (to my knowledge) to talk about depression, except here. Are there any sort of discord groups or anything like that that focus on depression? Maybe even YouTubers that talk about their problems with depression. Sometimes depression hits me at the worst times, so there are times where I can't really talk to people for a bit because everyone could be at work or asleep. I think it would be cool to have a place to go to to talk with like minded people that is maybe a little faster than making a reddit post. I hope I can become active in this community as well.

She currently already have a SO while I‚Äôm still trying to get pass my recent break up. I can‚Äôt put up the courage to go up to them and act like I‚Äôm not having an emotional breakdown. I just can‚Äôt put into words how to explain this, I just know I desperately need help. Not to get with her somehow, but to move on from this very point",0
"I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs wrong with me, I‚Äôm young and generally not the worst person on this planet. Everyone seems to hate me though, which leads to me hating myself even more. I‚Äôm tired of being alone. Granted, I have an awesome online boyfriend but it‚Äôs not the same. I want friends and I feel pathetic for saying that. This morning I get to look at everyone‚Äôs fun party last night and it makes me even more depressed. It‚Äôs probably because I push people away.",1
"In this world full of wifi connection, human connection seems obsolete. I feel so alone. It's a cliche feeling, I know. Me against the world and nobody is on my side. The world is winning, etc. But I just feel so down. So so so depressed. I told myself that this 2018 I will embrace what is real - real people, real words, real friends. And then I realized everyone around me is fake. I envy those people who have friends who stick with them whatever happens. I wonder if I could still find real friends nowadays. Just one real friend would be nice. Just so I don't feel this way anymore. Some will say this too shall pass but it has been weeks and it ain't done yet.",1
"A lonely hurt in my lower chest, a mild stomachache, and despair. Numb to any positive emotion. Can't laugh. Can't smile. I'm dead inside.",0

"I tell myself this every year. But I am fed up with living every day. I don't want to get out of bed, I just want to die. I hate my home I hate my family and I hate my life. I have tried to kill myself ever since I was 5, I was not meant to be in this world. I am very sick as well, and hate being sick. I had a fun New Years up until I got home. It's 3:02 and I'm disappointed with myself again. I've been to therapy and a psychiatrist but nothing works. I have a job already but I lack the skills to talk to others, I try and have improved a lot but other times I always feel like they're talking bad about me. I work hard but I never think it's hard enough. I think I'll have to get three jobs soon due to starting college and I honestly don't want to be 30 or 40 still having to pay student loans. I think I am going to kill myself this year. I made a post on here similar to this but ended up not doing it because I couldn't leave my friend alone. But now we barley talk.",1
After multiple admissions to hospital and trying heaps of different medication my doctor has recommended I try TMS. I was wondering if anyone here had any experience with it and if they could tell me what to expect. I'm a bit sceptical but I'm willing to give it a go.,0
"I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs an active forum somewhere online I can chat with others at. Talking to someone 1 on 1 on reddit has always bothered me, so I appreciate anyone who offers but I‚Äôm definitely looking more for a casual group setting so I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm the center of attention. I may feel like I want to die but I‚Äôm definitely not going to do it tonight, others could use the help.",0
"I've had a prescription for citalopram for 6 months but I am too scared to try it. I've never taken a depression med before, but I've heard in a lot of cases that it makes the depression worse, sometimes before it gets better, and sometimes it never gets better and then they gotta find a different med that does work. I'm scared because I can't imagine my depression getting any worse than it already is. I don't think I could function, heck, I can barely function as it is now. I literally push myself because I'm too embarrassed not to. Has anyone here been on citalopram? If so, what was it like? What were the immediate effects?",0
Forgive me if I sound extremely stupid but I've finally convinced myself after years of ignoring my depression to go see a doctor. I'm confused as to how the process works if a person does get prescribed medication. I know there are tons of different kinds of medication so how does the doctor know which one to prescribe? Do you have a say in which antidepressants you're leaning towards? I know some of them have severe side effects so I'm wondering if after they've talked with you to inspect you if they give you a choice from a list they feel is best or if they usually start you off the bat with one kind of medication without questions asked.,0
"It's new years but that hasn't sparked this post. This post was created out of loneliness. I always find myself feeling so stupid, but I am just not satisfied and if i'm stupid so be it. I thought getting financial freedom would bring me happiness, and it hasn't. I'm even more sad now that I have no obligations. I just keep thinking about the point to anything, and I can never find it. The only thing that keeps me happy is listening to very old vocaloid songs, but no one ever wants to listen to vocaloid with me. It makes sense though, i'm a 21 year old man now and it doesn't make sense for me to enjoy such a dumb and girly and cringy type of music, I get it. I just sit around these days listening to vocaloid or electronic music longing for the days back in middle school and highschool when I wasn't aware of how irrelevent these types of music were around me. When I got lost in these worlds and had no cares in the world. I don't like most people. I don't know what to do now. Years of isolation to become financially free and no happiness to gain from it.",0
"I‚Äôm 15 years old, and I turn 16 in 9 days. I feel lonely all the time and only have a few friends. It gets pretty bad sometimes and I start to think about killing myself. When I feel this way, i usually can‚Äôt sleep and am an emotional train wreck. Is this normal or am I crazy or what?",0
"It's like this: when I can't leave my bed, when I'm crying all the time, when I'm constantly late to work, when I haven't showered in weeks, I can tell myself: these are very clear, objective signs of depression. No wonder you're struggling with everything. Be kind to yourself. When I'm able to hold a steady job without screwing up, when I can keep in touch with family pretty consistently, when I can clean my apartment: it makes all the things I still struggle with seem to be due to personal failings rather than disorder. So I hate myself. I can't focus enough to watch a movie or read a book? Well, you can be on the internet for hours, so you're not trying hard enough to focus. I've completely ghosted most of my friends? Well, you can still contact your family and two of your friends, so you're not really socially anxious; you're just an asshole. I'm slow to speak and struggle to find words? Your brain is working better than when you were REALLY depressed, so you're a boring person with nothing interesting to say. By the way, you're a lot dumber now because the real depressive episodes ruined a bunch of brain matter. I feel ""meh"" and numb all the time? You're not trying hard enough to experience new things. You get up to go to work; you should be able to easily get up and take a walk when you have the day off. I don't know where I'm going with this.",1
"This time last year, I was talking to my soon-to-be girlfriend, excited for the new year. Now I'm alone, suicidal and worse than last year. Shit doesn't change. New years resolutions don't mean shit when no matter what you do, no matter how hard you try, you'll still be fucked over by everyone you trust. I hope I find the courage to kill myself this year.",0
"My dog is being fostered by a friend. Dog escaped. Friend called freaking out. I freaked out. Boyfriend freaked out and wanted to drive to get dog. I said no because he‚Äôs been drinking. LOST HIS SHIT. Tried to talk to him, pushed for it despite his attempts to distance himself. I have been pushed, smacked wth a shoe, dumped, called all kinds of names in the book.. there are holes in my walls, my belongings are smashed and destroyed.. we literally just talked about our future together 4 hours ago... then bam.. I am a stupid cunt piece of shit bitch. It 4.5 hours in to 2018 and I am praying I dont wake up. It‚Äôs all my fault I should have just left him alone.. nothing I ever do is right. Ever.

"My best friend kept some of my old sketchbooks from when I was 10, which was pretty crazy to read. I'd written her into my kill list and said I didn't like her, and some other mean stuff. I was also saying stuff like ""I'm going to commit suicide tomorrow"" and drew really emo pictures all throughout, I'd completely forgotten about it. Anyways, we burned it. I guess I've just always been a very emo person. I feel bad I've written all that stuff about her, it came out of jealously honestly because she's only ever been nice to me but she's beautiful, and I could see even then when everybody pretended she wasn't. I'm also really self-obsessed and ungrateful, I'm realising. I don't message back people that are very good to me, I'm only ever looking out for myself, I don't make an effort to see my lifelong friend too much. Well I have a lot of work to do. I might feel like shit a lot but I don't want to make other people feel the same way.",1
"I have a lot of good things going for me, but I have no interest in putting effort into those things. My first semester of college went pretty well, but I just don‚Äôt care about what I‚Äôm doing. I don‚Äôt care if I ever get a job or a girlfriend or have a family. I could die alone and be completely indifferent to it. It genuinely feels effortful to try to care about things and have an interest in them. I don‚Äôt see a point in sharing my condition with anyone because if I‚Äôm being honest they‚Äôre not going to understand. Either that or they‚Äôll pretend they do understand and be fucking annoying about it. I‚Äôm already tired of writing this out and considered not even posting several times",0
"hi everyone I had been doing so well, I was a year and two months SH-clean. I was planning a tattoo to get that would cover all my old scars. but tonight brought on an depressive episode that I‚Äôve never experienced before. on my way home, I was wailing/sobbing, talking out loud to myself about what was wrong with me, and then I had a thought that ceased the wailing and brought me to complete silence for the rest of the night. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to kill myself.‚Äù When I got home, I got into comfortable pajamas and researched lethal doses of the medicines I have in my cabinet. I wrote out a note, telling my family and friends that I love them. I was nearly about to take the pills, when my cat came around the corner and started purring. She rubbed herself around my ankles, meowing at me happily. I broke down in tears, realizing what I was about to do. I later cut myself, which I justified to myself as being an ‚Äúalternative‚Äù to suicide. Time to start the countup over.",0
"I started the new year drunk and now first time high. And you know what? I'm going to still be depressed as fucking ever this year and I'm betting if I keep this up I'm going to kill myself this year. A new year doesn't mean anything just more time to explore depressed, more time to hate yourself and I might just be so fucking gone this morning to think straight but honestly I don't want anything to happen this year except me killing myself because there's no fucking point anymore. I'd rather just fucking off myself and end this year without anymore fucking suffering",0
"My parents are divorced since I was 3. No big deal, many people started off worse. I've been living with my mom and rarely meet my dad because I'm too busy. Recently, I met up with my dad and my foster mother, and they thought I might have some psychological problems. Not severe, but still. They wanted to get me checked out. But my mom don't agree. She thought the other parents were overreacting. Personally I do feel off balance at times, and I WOULD get myself tested just to see if I'm okay or not. But even when I expressed that wish, mom still wouldn't take it more seriously and ignore it. I don't want to come to my dad crying out for help because that would just make my mom and dad argue once more, and many many more problems regarding my family might ensue. But I still feel really upset with the fact that mom wouldn't get me any help even though it costs her nothing. Thanks for reading, I know there are people being in way worse situations than I am, but I just need to take this off my mind.",0
"Right now im sitting at my desk at 2 in the morning with the love of my life sleeping in the next room. I should be happy, why am I not, nothing seems wrong. Schools going well, jobs good and yet I still end up feeling like im drowning. I normally can ignore it but sometimes it just gets too much and I end up like I am now crying at my desk with no real reason why. I don't even really know why I'm saying all this just feel the need to vent for some reason. I'm not looking for feedback and even if I was I don't know what it would be for. I'm just so confused",0
I really can't remember. 2018 marks that I've been pretty solidly depressed for ten years.,0
I get it. I'm awkward at parties. I'd probably say no if you invited me to a huge party anyway. Doesn't mean I don't want to be invited. And when it's 4 or 5 of my 'closest friends' all having fun and playing board games together and no one wanted me to be there it makes me feel the worst I've felt since I started taking antidepressants. I don't want to feel like this any more. I don't want to feel anything any more. I spent so long trying to convince myself that there's no huge fucking glaring flaw with my personality that drives people away but I guess the universe just keeps trying to convince me otherwise. Why is this so hard,1

"I find myself frequenting this sub a lot, usual late at night listening to some music. The problem is personally I do not suffer from any sort of depression. In fact I'm glad that I consider my life is pretty decent, albeit with a few shortcomings. Being the start of a new year I see many posts here talking about self improvement and finally fighting the problems that have been plaguing some people for years. I've come to say that you all can do it, everyone of you can achieve and be something greater. It may seem like it's impossible for some, but life is a hard, hard road. You don't have to be depressed to know life is quite the bitch and throws you around all the time. But having the strength to keep going and fighting for yourself is what keeps us all here. The fact all of you are here is a miracle in itself, and while many people may see it as more of a curse than a blessing, just know that life has strange ways of working, and everyone here has the ability to live up to what they want to be It may not seem like it right now, hell it may not feel like it a few years from now, but just always know that your life is important, you matter, to all of us, but more importantly, you matter to yourself.",0

Nobody will dislike me if I just sit here quietly and try not to annoy anyone. I‚Äôm afraid that I‚Äôm going to grow old and be alone. My greatest fear is that I will one day be a fat middle aged man who has never has anything resembling a love life because he‚Äôs too afraid to express his true emotions to anyone.

Because i've sat for numerous hours thinking about it, but can't see any way it would help?

I don't care about anything or anyone and I feel detached from society as a result. I've done it all. Eaten a great diet, exercised daily, I don't drink or smoke or do drugs and yet my body hates me. Sick of pretending. Money is everything and you are judged solely on your ability to make more of it. I wouldn't wish this intense feeling of emptiness and loneliness on anybody. I want out. I really don't know what to do. I've tried. Therapy, meds. I hope I don't wake up soon. This life might not be for me. How pathetic I'm telling strangers. Nobody else. I have nobody else. EDIT - Ok so I honestly expected zero replies. I don't know what to say. I'd like to say I feel better but I don't. Thank you.",1
"I had someone I barely know trying to offer advice last night. He's one of those ""you should go seek help"" types. No shit - wouldn't that be nice? I *did* when I had the ""luxury"" of health insurance. I'm on my own now, though, and am doing my fucking best. It felt like it came out of nowhere, too, when he initiated the call and wanted to hear me participate more in voice with group chats. I'd made jokes about needing time to remember how to speak after so much tension with family, and think he may have gotten the wrong impression. He started offering new employment routes, which, while appreciated, also just overwhelmed me even more. I'd already told him that I technically have two businesses, one teaching guitar and the other gardening. He was offering stuff completely unrelated and out of my field. I'd like to look into them, but I have multiple learning disabilities and mental illnesses over here. It's gonna take time I would like to talk to him more about it, but felt I needed to rant and hopefully clear my head. If anyone has suggestions, I would truly appreciate it Also, happy new year:)",0
Why should I live? I have no friends... My family is horrible... Everyone hates me... Noone cares about me... Who ever cares about me leaves me... I'll forever be alone.,0
"I‚Äôve posted here a lot over the last year on both this account and others. I‚Äôve struggled with depression and anxiety for a very long time and it felt like things weren‚Äôt going to get any better. I was giving up. However, about 4 months ago I had perhaps the worse mental breakdown In my life. Everything kind of happened at once and I hit rock bottom. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to go to work. I spent my days in my room crying. I was angry and miserable. I was a mess. Eventually my sister and brother in law came to my aid and pushed me to get better. We found me a new less stressful job away from my triggers. I opened up about my mental illness. I got a new doctor who took interest in my problems and prescribed me medication and guides to conquer them. I started a new job that I really enjoy. I also started dating this guy that has gone through some of the same struggles and understands how I feel. It‚Äôs been an incredible 4 months. I know it‚Äôs not this easy for others but I got lucky. I also want to thank the people who would give me advice. Thanks guys! Happy New Year!",0

"I‚Äôve always had depression, and it‚Äôs gotten really bad this year. It‚Äôs affecting every aspect of my life, I‚Äôve pushed most of my friends away, barely been talking to my family, my finances are a mess, and worst of all, my performance at work has gotten really bad. My boss is very hands off, so no one knew how behind I had gotten, what a mess I‚Äôd made of my work. Well last week I got a kidney stone and had to be out several days, and when I was gone they discovered how bad I was doing. Ugh. Now, Tuesday first thing in the morning I have a meeting with my boss and HER boss called ‚Äúdiscussion about performance‚Äù and I think it‚Äôs extremely likely I get fired. Even though I find it REALLY hard to talk about, I‚Äôm considering just being totally honest and talking to them about my depression, and how much it‚Äôs eacallated this year. Let them know that it‚Äôs not just my work that has suffered, but my finances, soicial life, family life, health, everything. I‚Äôm not trying to use it as an excuse, it‚Äôs just the truth. I don‚Äôt know that it will save my job, but at this point I don‚Äôt know what else to do. Has anyone ever done this. What do you think? Any advice? I‚Äôm so scared of losing my job and just spiraling further and further down.",0
i'm so scared and i'm scared to tell anyone. once i open up they all just run away. it's hard to be awake while i'm in such big pain. i'm so scared i wish i could go back in time. 2018 already fucking sucks but it doesn't really even matter because time is a made up concept and my suffering won't stop :),0
I just need someone to talk to I‚Äôm tired of caring and no one else reciprocating I want a friend. I just want someone to care.,0
My depression has gotten so much worse the past couple weeks and I‚Äôve been trying to hide it as best I can at work. I guess I wasn‚Äôt doing a great job at it because today one of my coworkers walked up to me randomly just to give me a hug. It‚Äôs amazing how much just one hug helped me get through the day,0

"I was with a group of friends last night, and another friend started talking to another friend about how many girls secretly liked him and stuff. It was crazy, because no one has ever talked to me about things like that. Then, on the way to the pub, a group of girls basically called me unattractive. Funny how girls are never shy about calling me ugly, but they're apparently too shy to ""approach me"". I never get signals, I've had shit luck on dating sites, no one ever approaches me, no one has ever had a crush on me, and my family are the only people that call me handsome. Nothing tells me that I'm ugly based on how girls treat me versus how they treat other guys. Yes. I lift and dress well, too.",0

I have 1700 hours in CS:GO and I'm worse than people with half my hours, I played (association) football my whole life and I was always trash at that, I tried to do guitar for a few years when I was younger but I got kicked out because the teacher thought I wasn't practising-I was, I just was really bad at it. I have a few friends but they don't like me that much and I don't blame them because I'm a bad person to be friends with, I am boring, I have no distinct interests and I can't hold a conversation for more than 5 seconds. I just don't understand why I should like myself, if anything it'd be irrational not to hate myself because every single aspect of my life is going terribly and it's ultimately no-one's fault but my own.",1

Regretting getting into it. But now no turning back. I'd enjoy it, or be less stressed about it if not for monstrous lecturers. Every morning I wake up thinking what will I get chewed out for today **Future :** Bleak. Specially job-wise. Relationships also have been forced so far, in my sad attempts to be a normal person. Marriage and kids don't look like its happening. In my culture this is undesirable. I'm the weirdo **Religion :** Have to fake it. There is no freedom of religion where I am from. Sometimes normal people things make me feel conflicted. In the west its OK for casual sex, drinks etc. Here people do it too, even if they believe in God. Funny thing is, I'm the one with faith issues and yet I'm the one feeling guilty even thinking about these things. **Mentality :** I can't bring myself to compromise. I can't be happy if I can't make others happy or proud of me. But doing what makes me happy most likely would make people (family mostly) detest me. **Age :** Not getting any younger. Wasting my youth in pursuit of a grueling career. Never had any fun. People think I'm weird. I wish I were deleted.",1

To the point where I've had enough. I'm fucking struggling man. I want to scream for help but doing so does nothing. I know that life is balanced with the good and the bad, I understand and accept that, but it's getting out of hand, I see no point in living. Tell me, what is the point of lving? To see your closest friends crumble to dust whilst your trying to stop your self from crumbling? To be given the answers on how to get better yet not being able to do them? I can't hack this life.

"The next sorry excuse for a piece of shit that says that suicide is a ""permanent solution to a temporary problem"" might just get taken along with me. It's not one problem, or two problems, or three problems I'm dealing with: I am besieged by problems. Every fucking where I look I'm inundated with them. Problems I have no solutions for and have run dry on ideas. I can't help but think of wartime. If everything you know of the enemy is that they have no mercy, that they are ruthless, and that they will do nothing but torture you, and you find yourself surrounded by them, history shows us that people in such a situation would often choose to take their own life rather than suffer such a fate. Back to us, today. A permanent solution to all of my problems sounds pretty fucking nice. If you could find a way out of such a situation, I believe you would have found a working cure for over 80% of suicide. Until then, you can cram your platitudes up your fucking ass.",0
"I spent the last few hours of New Years Eve alone crying. Crying because of everything. The stress of college, my anxiety, my loneliness, no one likes me at school even though I do try, people hate me when I haven‚Äôt done anything to them, parents that won‚Äôt help me, an emotionally abusive father, I‚Äôm in an online relationship that seems bleak more and more everyday, my boyfriend is out with all his friends and I‚Äôm here alone in pain.

"Like right now, I just got up. I need to feed my pets, clean the litter box, brush my teeth, start some laundry, and eat something. It feels like too much. I'm so anxious right now, and I just want to go back to bed and shut down. I don't care about today. I don't want it. But if I get it all done, I'll probably feel okay. That's not the case every day, but today I feel like I could get to a good place if I try. But then what? Tomorrow starts the same way. Too much to do. Everything's too hard and I feel sh!tty. Until I get some things done and the weight is lifted. Heck, even two hours from now I'll be in the same boat. There's always stuff to do. I need to clean the house, make some phone calls, shovel snow, get dressed, eat again. It never stops. And sometimes I can feel good when I've gotten somewhat on top of things, but what's the point? It's like an endless wild goose chase. Shouldn't I be able to just feel good, regardless of the conditions around me or what's on my to-do list? Also, this is just basic stuff. I don't have any kids, relationships to manage, projects or hobbies, and only about 20 hours of work a week. I'm just trying to keep myself and my animals from starving or dying from poverty, filth, or negligence. And it's so hard. I'm going to go do that list of morning stuff, because at least it'll keep things from getting worse. But I just wish it didn't feel so futile.",0

I have nothing. No job or income, no one to love, no properties, and close friends I've had just keep turning their backs on me and making me feel worse as if I never meant anything to them. I just want it to end. I don't want to live anymore, my life has no meaning, nobody listens to me and the ones that do don't understand it or give the old ""you shouldn't feel like that"". I don't think I will make it through this new year, not that most people would actually care enough to even notice if I'm gone I want this suffering to end, I'm slipping deeper and deeper into the thought of ending it all.

It might be loneliness, grief, pain, or feeling lost. There's one instance where I was suicidal, long story short I think scared a lot of people that were close to me.

I know what I should be doing: start progressing and stop brooding, but I can't find it in me to snap out of this. I have no energy for anything. Suicidal thoughts come and go although I have no energy to deliberately kill myself, but I'm praying for my accidental death. I'm on school vacation and by the time I return to my classes, everyone would notice this change in my behavior and performance. How can I return to my normal life? P.S.

I'll make the effort to do something positive but then things will will just fall apart. I'm only 25 and I really have to question how much longer I can go on like this. I don't enjoy anything anymore and I'm just not right anymore. I've been having some very dark thoughts about hurting myself and I find them to be quite troublesome, they just seem to pull me into an even darker place.",1

I want to cry a lot but I seem to get moments like this. I don't understand it. I just want to be left alone by everything and want to just crawl up in a ball and cry all the time. Has anyone had an experience of this? I feel so bad though. My Mum is putting up with a lot with me and doesn't deserve the shouting, smashing and me crying all the time.

"As the title suggests I could really use some advice. I‚Äôve been struggling with depression for years, with this latest episode affecting me since mid-November. It is now January 2018 and although I‚Äôve had some good times and didn‚Äôt really feel depressed over the Holidays, it all just came flooding back last night. All of my friends ended up bailing on me on New Years so I spent the night alone in my room until I fell asleep around 9 pm. I woke up around 3 in the morning and stupidly checked my phone. When I did I saw all the friends that bailed on me at different parties, surrounded by others, having fun. This sent me spiraling back into depression and I found myself close to ending my life with a belt which I‚Äôve read can be very painless. I was able to take some medication that helped me go to sleep again and get through the night. It‚Äôs now 1:30 in the afternoon and I still feel the same way with absolutely nobody to talk to about this because I don‚Äôt want to be that person that brings somebody down on New Years. It just feels as if no matter what medications I take, whatever therapist I have, and even with these group therapy sessions I‚Äôve been attending, I always end up back on the train to death. It‚Äôs starting to feel like the only solution as I‚Äôve tried making some major changes in my life and none of them have made any impact when others have told me they would.

Besides that, I asked if she liked me back and she responded with, ""Yeah, but as a friend"" She said she didnt want to friend zone be but she has her eyes on someone else *She's pansexual and she likes another girl* Im so sad.

Depression is a battle. Your always fighting yourself. Every word is a punch in the gut. Every movement puts a bullet in your chest. Every breath is taken. Depression is a nightmare. You can't wake up. You can't leave the dreams of who you used to be. You can't escape it. Depression is a cloud. It's always hovering over you. It's always going to rain. It's going to make the days grey. Depression is a monster. It will be everywhere. The closet. Under the bed. In the window. Depression is a battle that a lot of people go against and it may seem like you can't fight. But darling you'll win.,0

"Primarily, I don‚Äôt mean to mislead you all with the clickbait-esque title. I didn‚Äôt know how else to phrase it. Anyways, on to what I made this post for. While I don‚Äôt have the constant urge to kill myself, it does appear in my mind a lot. Every so often per week the urge will (for a short period of time) come up again. In those moments I find myself lying on my stomach on my bed, my hands either stiffly folded behind my back, so that I can‚Äôt do anything to myself, or out in front of me gripping the edge of the bed, so that I can not in any way get up from my bed to harm myself. I find this tactic works, but I wish I didn‚Äôt have to use it. You see, there‚Äôs are times that I really, *really* want to‚Äîno I *need* to cry, but no tears come out. It‚Äôs awful. I‚Äôm not dehydrated, so my body can afford to cry, but it just *doesn‚Äôt*. Instead I end up fighting to suppress tears at the most inconvenient moments. I feel so over-dramatic for making this post, because others who make these types of posts have *such better reason* behind theirs, and I feel as if my ""reason"", which is stated in the first few sentences, seems pathetic.

He's an excellent listener and an interesting guy, I've texted him and he's texted me since then. Sometimes I tell him about my depression and my eating disorder, and how awful I feel. He listens patiently, gives sympathy, and makes some suggestions without being presumptuous. But he never tells me about his life. Even if I ask. He has never tried to share any of his own problems with me. Ever. It was even like this when I was still dating him. When he texts me first, it's to ask how I'm doing. Any time I get quiet for a while, he stops contacting me. Even for months at a time. Then when I come back again, crying about my own problems, he's there to listen. Patiently. It's obvious I'm not his friend. He tells me he's glad we met. But he only talks to me for my benefit. He's doing a good deed. I deactivated my facebook messenger since that's how I usually contacted him. He has my phone number. But he will not use it. Maybe this time I'll finally leave him alone.",0

"I broke up with my girlfriend about 3 months ago because I wanted to move to a place she didn‚Äôt want to move to, I really wanted to move there as I‚Äôve always wanted to live there and I have lots of friends there, so we broke up and I moved. For the first 3 months I was really happy and perfectly fine, I was sad of course from losing my girlfriend of a year and a half but it had to happen if I wanted to move and I knew that. These last couple of days though I just feel so lonely and depressed, I just want to drink constantly, I drank last night and the night before, and it‚Äôs only 11am and I already feel like drinking again. I don‚Äôt think I miss her specifically but I miss having a girlfriend, having someone to love and feel a connection with.",0
"2017 was a shit show. I sat in my room alone last night and watched the ball drop. Today I woke up still depressed. Just a reminder to anyone else struggling that nothing is going to change instantly for you just cause it‚Äôs a new year, take it one day at a time. We‚Äôll be alright.",0
"It was like a big fucking slap to the face. A reminder of how fucking depressed and hopeless I am compared to the rest of my family members.

I am doing everything in my power to not break down in tears. They ask why I don't want to play with them or why I always look sad. I can't tell them that I'm broken inside. That I want to go home and hang myself the moment their parents come home. I can't do it anymore.,0
"So my boyfriend has pretty severe depression. I'm the only person he talks to about it, and it's good that he can at least talk to someone, but I think he should tell his parents so he could try to get professional help. He refuses to talk to anyone but me about it and believes that a therapist can't help him, no matter how hard I've tried to convince him. He also believes taking medicine wouldn't help, even though I have tried to convince him. He is suicidal at least once a day and I'm worried that one day he will just do it. Any ways to help him (I know everyone is different but any general advice) would be appreciated.",0

"I've been dealing with mild depression since October (self-diagnosed, nothing formal). I've mostly been able to deal with it. The last few months though, it's slowly getting worse. The lack of energy, loss of interest in enjoyed activities. All I do is work is come home. On the weekends, I just turn hermit and avoid things. Even doing self care doesn't help. Today, I haven't been out of bed except to go to the bathroom and eat a bagel. My roommate came in to talk and see if I was okay. He had helped me in the past deal with this, but even he's not sure what to do. In about 3 months, I'm supposed to move in with the love of my life. I'm moving to another state to do it. I know I need to start therapy, but I know changing therapists at the beginning of recovery can be dangerous. I'm so lost that I just don't know where to start.",0
"In all shortness I just moved and tomorrow at noon I gotta hand in the keys for the old flat, but here I am on the floor in my old flat and have yet to empty all the cupboards in the kitchen and do all the cleaning. There's at least one large car load worth of things to move and I havent got a car or a license - so cant even rent a car and get it done. First I thought to walk with things (only moved a few blocks), like I have already done two times, but it's notably difficult to do so (and since it's getting late I'm contemplating a taxi. One can use a taxi for this, right?). I've had months to get this all done but of course here I am having procrastinated like hell and dealt with anxiety by knocking myself out cold to sleep. And since the support system is 99% parents I keep silent about this and dont wanna bother them more than this move already has. So yet again I've put myself in an utterly idiotic position of misery. Tomorrow comes with work again but I am honestly contemplating calling in sick and dealing with this shit between morning and noon instead of now (been here all day and it is now late evening). Another sad part is that today has actually been a very productive day compared to what I normally pull off. And this just sucks. Landing myself in this position sucks, getting myself out of this position sucks. When it's done and over with it will still suck.",0

I've been depressed all of my adult life and I worry if I get better from this, what if I do not like the new version of myself? I guess I don't know what part of my personality is a mental illness and what part is actually who I am, and so if I tame the mental illness then what if I don't like the version of me that's left? Has anyone felt like this, and if so how did you approach the recovery process? I cannot afford medication or therapy so I am in the process of making my own plan of action to help me out until I can find a therapist on a sliding scale (the waiting lists are a bitch where I live for this sort of thing).

"2017 was rough. My brain fell into cycles of self degradation way too easily, this led me down a spiral this year which made me end a long relationship, lose some friends, and made me put duties that would have helped me to the wayside like taking my dog out. The past few months leading to now has been anti social to say the least. I stopped trying to make plans with friends as I was tired of hearing no, my friends clearly didn't want me around a whole lot (since September I had a total of 2 outings with friends, pre September we spent probably too much time together at ~6 days a week). On top of that another good friend of mine moved away indefinitely. 2017 I realized I can't rely on my friends the way I thought I could, I wish I could but life doesn't work like that. My New Years resolution this year is to not base my happiness and social success around if my friends and I are having fun. I've realized I don't need my friends to go play an open Mic night, or go see a movie, or to go for a hike, in fact a lot of these are better done alone. 2017 my friends left me high and dry 2018 they're not gonna be able to",0
"I just left a happy but low paid job which I excelled at for one with better money and better prospects. But I absolutely hate it. I hate the thought of being there.

I understand that there comes nerves with a new start but I'm starting to wonder if it's all worth the effort if I was so much happier in my previous job, not just doing the work but it didn't invade my life with thoughts when I wasn't there. I have suffered from depression before, though not connected to work, and I can feel that the longer I am at my new job the less I'm enjoying my life. I've been absolutely miserable and unwanting to do anything in the past week. I don't know what to do. Any kind words would be greatly appreciated.",0

I never got anything when I returned but a single lecture about how nobody is gonna care if I do it again bc I'm 19. They're probably right. Word travels fast in my family, and I believe I've ruined New Years for everyone. I dont want to face everyone anymore. None of them understand what I'm going through. I have no friends to talk to anymore. My brother and sister ignore me and dont like me. My parents also ignore what I'm going through and suggest that I shouldnt be depressed bc theyre depressed even more. All my aunts and uncles who think they help say that too. Im rambling at this point... Right now, im laying in my bed, legs sore, body numb, and drowning in despair. I dont know where to go. I want to end it but im afraid to. I want leave but i dont know where to go. And even if i do, i wont know how to start my life back again and for that, I'm scared. Even so, im considering doing things i would never have done before.

"With severe anxiety and body dysmorphia it's extremely hard for me to connect socially, though being more social is something I wanted to do this year.

Then today she wrote me that she won't attend the dancing courses with me out of consideration for her boyfriend. Yes, be considerate of your boyfriend, who cares about ugly useless me.

"From what I've seen, people suffering from depression feel down even though things around them are somewhat okay. As for me, I just got divorced, my ex-wife is an incredibly manipulative narcissist, and we have a young child together. She's accused me of horrible things that I would never do in a failed attempt at full custody. I'm constantly battling her over our child. In the past she has successfully isolated and controlled me through guilt and accusations. She almost succeeded in manipulating the courts. The legal fees appear to be leaving me bankrupt. My thoughts are full of her, her constant false accusations and how to defend against them. I'm on a tenure track at a university, but that job is f-ed now because I can't concentrate on my research for longer than 5 minutes. So yeah, I'm kind of feeling down. My ex is abusive and is so good at it that the legal system and even women's abuse counselors will back her and protect her. I'm in therapy. Started going to church. Prayer helps me get back to sleep now. Trying to cut down on drinking. Exercising a lot. Still can't focus on work, so I'm now focusing on how to change careers and stay in the same area (close to our child.) What should I do? Am I suffering from depression? When this abuse and false accusations first started a few years ago, I thought about wanting to die. My career is f-ed now because of this. That makes me worry about future custody battles.

I haven't graduated college yet, I work to sustain myself, pay rent and food, while trying to finish my career and get my degree. But, my extended relatives who used to support me financially (since my mom never did it) insulted me for not spengind New Year's Eve with them.

They didn't care about my depression, anxiety or suicide attempts. Depression started for me since I was 12, today I am 22. I have battling with disease alone, no meds, got therapy just twice because I couldn't afford more, but still they say I have no right to complain since ""they had horrible childhoods and I didn't have to sell anything on the streets"". I am really scared because I am afraid of losing my job and I don't want them to hurt me.

Early on I lost loads of weight, lost myself in darkness and music, never had lights on, stayed in my room nearly all the time, slept a tonne and just isolated myself. I've spoken to people (professionally etc) and tried pills (which I hated and stopped very fast) and I've been forced to hospitalize myself, had a psychosis evaluation, spent hours on the phone with samaritans, heard voices, panic attacks, paranoia, nearly went for CBT, been down a huge road of referrals, sliced and burnt myself, suicidal thoughts invade my head 24/7, lost all my friends, my anxiety hit the roof. Blah blah blah you all know the drill Over time I have been getting better, little things change and slowly I feel better in myself These past few weeks though man I've just felt so okay, not upset at all, no telling myself to throw myself off a bridge, no urge to harm myself (how awfully embarrassing) and just generally been smiling a bit more Thing is I don't want to feel better I think..? Now I have no reason to be my boring as fuck self. That's just who I am, a boring lonley gross waste of space. You know when you can feel a massive load of tears just behind your face waiting to come out at any second? I've had that for a while now, both a mixture of happiness and sadness I am so alone, I can't talk to anyone to figure out what's wrong with my because if anyone asks I just sit in silence because I have nothing to say What is wrong with me?",0

"Almost a year ago, a attempted suicide. Since then, I've been on meds and doing therapy. Where did it got me? Lost all the friends I had left. I am even more depressed than before starting all this. Realised that it is just not in my head, people really doesn't care about depression or mental illness. So, here's to me. 2018 will be the year I will find peace. It will be the year I will stop bothering everyone with my existence. I am done trying when everyone wants me to give up.",1
"I just want to end it. It‚Äôs all I‚Äôve been thinking about for the past few days. I have no friends and no one will ever truly care about me. I haven‚Äôt been able to stop crying and the pain has just become unbearable. I just want it to go away. My parents and boyfriend push me to keep going and to try everyday to be happy but I just can‚Äôt fucking do it anymore. They don‚Äôt understand how hard it is. I just want it to go away. I dont want to study and have a good job, I don‚Äôt want to live. No life will ever make up for the pain I feel. I don‚Äôt actually have the courage to go and that makes me even more pathetic.",1

"02:00 AM. January 2. One year ago. At this moment, I committed suicide. I cut my wrists, arms, veins on joints both vertically and horizontally. Blood bath. Over 80 stitches. Exactly one year ago. Now, I'm looking at myself. Nothing has changed. I might be one of the mentally worst person here. Still. Edit: I just went away for something, when I got back :) :) Thank you all Edit2: Wow :) People of reddit, you are awesome. Thank you all for everything :)",0
Quick background... 4 year relationship ended about two months ago. Madly depressed because of it. Irresponsible of me to say that I was not taking my antidepressants until recently. But I can feel myself getting worse. Lately i have struggled with holding conversations. Today I could not leave my bed. I have started searching for a therapist. Is my body going to permanently change because of the prolonged severity?,0
"Does anybody ever get into a really 'bleh' mood all Sunday? Like you'll be fine the day before and after but that whole day you're just a different person it seems. But its not just always on Sundays, sometimes it happens on random days. I don't think it's my job because I like my job. So does anyone have any ways to combat this feeling? Things they like to do or focus on to that helps? TIA",0
I finally told my parents I was depressed and now they're getting me a therapist.,0
"Spent all day on the phone with my family crying. I‚Äôm not sure I have the strength to carry on anymore. I‚Äôve had to be ‚Äústrong‚Äù for such a long time and I can‚Äôt do it anymore. I‚Äôve been thinking about dying for a really long time. Multiple times a day, and after a lot of research I‚Äôve sort of unofficially settled on hanging in the absence of a better method. I realized I didn‚Äôt have anywhere to suspend from so that‚Äôs been a deterrent for most of this (or I should say last) year. But today I realized my door is high enough and sturdy enough to hang myself from and I‚Äôve been crying all day and feeling at rock bottom so I decided to test a possible hanging rig. I got my scarf around my neck and tightened it to the point that my face felt swollen and I couldn‚Äôt breathe. Kept it for a few seconds until my heart started to pound suddenly so I undid it. It wasn‚Äôt as unpleasant as I thought it would be. It wasn‚Äôt great but it was surprisingly not as unpleasant as I had always anticipated. This doesn‚Äôt give me hope in a weird way because you‚Äôd think feeling so desperate and so hopeless for so long, the potential of ending this suffering might bring relief but I think it‚Äôs more that I‚Äôve lost all ability to feel any kind of hope.",0
"I‚Äôve mentioned it a couple times on here lately, but my depression has been ruining most parts of my life, including job performance. I‚Äôve got a meeting in the morning with my bosses about my poor performance and I think I‚Äôll be fired. Does anyone have any similar experiences? How did you handle it? How would you begin to explain to your boss the toll depression takes on you and your performance. My meeting is at 8am tomorrow morning and I‚Äôm desperate to talk to people with similar experiences. Thank you so much. **Update:** Thank you everyone for your support, kind words, and sharing your own experiences. I had the meeting today. I have to admit I broke down a bit, had trouble getting sentences out, but I tried my best to explain how depression was affecting me and my job performance. They were very kind and understanding, but still said I need to either resign or they will have to start the termination process. Long story short: It‚Äôs over, I failed again.",0

"But I would only be depressed most of the time, 4-5/12 months or more (plus at least 3 months of self- disliking/ hate). So I would drag that person down with me, if he/she loved me too. So I don't know if two-sided love would be the best case or worst case. I think I'm just a burden, because most of the time I am useless and super demotivated (except for some manic phases which are &lt;2 hours long). So I can probably never get rid of all these negative feelings. I tried, it didn't work 2/2 times. So what can I do except for killing myself? I am sick, everything I think is probably wrong or distorted, and this stuff will keep coming back, will never go away. I am just a waste of time, money and nerves. Much of all of that. And I don't even feel much about it. The only feeling I have are sadness, some relieve when it's gone for the short manic phases (after which I am crushed down by falling again) and hurt, so much hurt. But for some time now I've just been numb. Could you call it a rational decision to end my life? I had one person I thought needs me. But he is also just depressed and I can't stop his hurting.

It‚Äôs so hard for me to express what im feeling and ive tried talking to professionals (in my school) and when im talking to them I dont feel what I feel when im alone so they dont understand, not saying i understand either because i dont know whats wrong with me or why i feel like this.

"Hi all, been having on/off therapy past 3 years for anxiety+depression and more recently for PTSD. Been aiming to be a better person and all that crap. Spent the best part of 30 years being extremely defensive which has decimated my social life,its basically zero. Anyhow, I'm really feeling like I'm not getting anywhere ATM so I'm giving up on the therapy and meds and feel better already but not sure if its too healthy.

"When I look at all the problems I have to face and all the issues I've got; my crippling anxiety issues, my huge insecurities about every part of me and my overwhelming jealousy leading to loneliness and isolation it all just seems impossible and pointless trying to fix it. It just seems so hopeless even thinking about how to solve these problems as they all seem so overwhelming and connected that no matter what I do they won't go away. I cannot even think of a place to start with all this mess because every time I try and fix something I'm just reminded of how this other issue will still be there and it's like whenever I come up with a solution another problem arises. What's worse is how every time I do try and sort my life out and it fails, which is every time, I become even more disillusioned and deterred from trying again in the future, because it will just be pointless. It's pretty fucking depressing that the first thought I wake up to on the start of a new year is how it would be easier killing myself then hopelessly trying to fix my problems. I wish I could just be rid of all this shit and be a normal person, it's fucking scary thinking about how this is how I could be forever.",1
"I think the relationship btw money and ur mental health is just direct! If i have so much money i guess i wouldn't be so damn miserable!

Let's just all admit that happiness is really purely depend on how much freaking money you have, we need to stop telling people or ourselves that money isn't everything, this kind of denial mentality is so toxic! The more and sooner we realize it's the fact the sooner we will be able to end our lives. Don't u agree with me? It will never be better, it's just not!

I tripped acid on the 26th and basically was in a state of panic for 24~ hours and got taken advantage of by my sisters friends (my sister is a good person, but often doesn't see the bad in people).

No year will ever be perfect, each will bring bad things, so why is it that the entire population complains about specific years like they were the worst fucking thing that ever happened to them? It's hard for me to put what my thoughts are into text on this issue but basically what I'm saying is that years are just a measure of time and it's really dumb to waste your memory trying to remember which are good and which are bad. I get really pissed around new years because all I fucking hear is people talking about how a year was amazing or shit due to fucking 3 or less events that happened during it.

So my ex and I were dating for a while. 2 years this April. Throughout the relationship we both ‚Äòflirted‚Äô with other people but never physically cheated. For the past couple months it wasn‚Äôt working and we mutually decided to call it off New Year‚Äôs Eve.

My ex and I spoke on the phone after it while I was driving home and agreed on whatever happened while we were single happened and wanted to talk after a few weeks and maybe give us another shot. The anxiety took over and I told her I slept with someone else and hearing her cry like that broke me even more.

"Hey everyone! Quick little backstory: I am 22 years old and have suffered from depression since I was around age 14. During that time I took Zoloft with a Xanax PRN for panic attacks. Earlier this year (around May 2017) my primary doctor upped my dosage by 50mg, I was then taking 150mg. My body adjusted to the increase and I hated how it made me feel. I felt worse than before. As if it worsened my symptoms. So, full well knowing the dangers of stopping a medication like Zoloft, I stopped taking it around the end of July 2017. At first I was fine. Them a month had gone by and I was bad. Then a few months later (Nov 2017) I was the worst I had ever been in my life. I lost 20lbs from Thanksgiving to now... I don't have an appetite, even though I feel hungry all the time. I have extreme fatigue. I am always tired, no matter how much sleep I get. I am stressed because student loans kick in this month ($515 a month), and I cannot afford to visit my family doctor because of $ I owe from previous visits. Is this 20lb sudden weight loss something that can be attributed to depression? I am generally a very healthy person. I workout daily, but haven't been able to the past month because of my extreme fatigue and depression. That's why it confuses me as to why I've lost weight. I am 22, female, athletic build, 6'0"" and 178lbs. Sorry if this is in the wrong subreddit. If it is, please direct me elsewhere. Thank you guys for your time. ‚ù§",0
"2017 for me was the equivalent of putting a load of expensive and high-end ingredients into a pot, cooking it, and having it taste rancid in the end. I had such great experiences and growth this year, but it feels like it hasn't given me the fulfilment I really want. I can't really tell this to anyone I know, since they'll think I am ungrateful or spoiled. My friends think I have everything going great for me, but those persistent nagging thoughts don't seem to agree. Anyone else feel this way or can relate?",0

"I should be happy. I have a job and a man who loves me and I live in a beautiful place because of him. I feel bad for feeling bad. All the shit in my life, the pain, the abuse, the rape...I don't even know if that's what hurts or if it's just the existential dread that I am nothing and am useless. I don't know if finishing grad school will even make me happy, because how could I ever be happy? I keep searching for meaning or being able to feel SOMETHING, literally anything but this blah-ness that encompasses everything I do. I drink, I go out, I go on rollar coasters, I run away for a month and nothing changes. Everything still feels like nothing. I'm empty. The only time I feel alive is when I'm playing video games because then I'm not me, I'm doing something totally abnormal. But my life is meaningless. There is not light, no happiness. I get brief glimpses of that feeling I don't even remember when my bf hugs me or shows he cares in some small way but overwhelmingly I'm just...empty. And it's isolating to feel like this. I feel so alone. He tries to understand but he doesn't live in my head, he can't know. I appreciate that he tries but I still feel overwhelmingly alone.",1
"I'm not sure if this is just because I'm growing up and becoming an adult, but I don't seem to have much emotion at all anymore. I just don't really care about anything, I'm never really sad and I'm never really happy. I'm just.. neutral.. all the time. Whereas in the past I remember having fun and happy times, I feel like happiness is a feeling that I *used* to experience, but I don't really get anymore. I'm just existing because that's what everyone else is doing, going about my day doing whatever, sorta like a robot with no purpose. I constantly ponder how meaningless everything is. I broke up with my girlfriend a few months ago and honestly, it barely affected me. My emotions just seem completely dulled down. Is that depression? Or something else?",0
Tonight my thoughts are closer than ever to becoming actions. I have temptations to see what tying a tie around my neck will feel like. These thoughts scare me and they're occurring more each day. I'm starting to come to the realisation that it's a never ending battle. A battle that I feel like I'm destined to lose and I'm not sure how long I'll last anymore.,1
"Cant even do a basic pizza job right... I work at a pizza place and I am probably my bosses worst employee ever. When I take the phone I mess up the order probably 50% of the time. After fucking things up all day my boss tells me to just go home and he will take the wasted food out of my check. I should do him a favor and quit cause its inevitable that ill get fired. Ive been working at this place for a week. I suck ass at this fucking job, the only thing I do right is wash dishes and deliver orders, everything else I always fuck it up somehow. I am calling tomorrow and saying I fuckin quit. FUCK my stupid brain I hope I get creamed by a semi on the way home. Think of that dumb fuck cashier that always fucks your order up. thats me. I'm a waste of,space and oxygen and all other resources you could think of. I should have been shot dead the day I was born. FUCK 2017",1
"Ok so I'm not gonna lie, I'm drunk, its New Year's day, and I have had a lot of time to self reflect lately. I've been off work from a bulging disc injury (I'm an STNA)and one of the biggest things that helps me fight my depression is working. I've had waaaayyy too much time to just think and dwell on things that don't necessarily have to be resolved but closure would be nice. One of which is, I'm the baby of the family...and I fear that I was babied so much that I was never actually punished or told what was right and what was wrong. I feel like my parents just didn't care anymore at that point because my first 3 sisters were exhausting. They just appeased me. Or tried too. The second is...was/is my perception of reality messed up, in more ways than I care to type out right now...or is am I just a brat that never learned her lessons...how the hell do I deal with it either way? TLDR:I feel like since I'm the baby of the family I was babied and wasn't taught the basics and principals of life. Now I'm just treading water till I feel like giving up.",0
"I have so many bad habits and unhelpful coping mechanisms... not to mention the years of personal development that I've missed out on by being too broken to be a functional human being. I've become so comfortable with failure that I can't even use the fear of it to motivate myself any more. I'm so accustomed to procrastinating that it feels like success to only miss a deadline once. Its so hard to stay motivated to work on getting better when all I'd earn by succeeding is the opportunity to be the same failure of a human being, just without depression as a scapegoat.",1

"The new year is already stressing me out. Last night was alright, and I was trying my best to stay positive. I woke up this morning feeling really good and motivated. But after yet another lonely, boring day I realized that I'm reaching too high because nothing's gonna change. I spent the day thinking about how I've never done anything cool, I don't have anything to be proud of, I have no friends, no money, nothing. I've lived a pointless boring life and it's not gonna change. Sorry if I'm not making any sense my mind's just all over the place right now",1
"I just realised on New Year's Eve, How much I hated myself. I'm a slow learner and went into college, very innocent and naive from a strict household. I tried to get laid but couldn't. College is easy for sex but I was struggling. I hate being a virgin. Now that college is done, I regret it and my wasted youth. I'm slowly losing my sanity and I've had enough of being clueless. I don't know where to start I'm not getting any younger. I went from optimistic to very depressed, self hating, isolated. Been going through abuse from my parents since 2, been depressed and numb for 20 years and bullying, I never had any friends, I got in an accident and permanently deformed. it got really bad the last 2 years, I had an autoimmune disorder. I don't want therapy, I can't afford it. I'm in 40k debt with a shit grade. I've never been allowed to have fun or play anything, I can't live my own life. It's all wasted. I'm going to end it soon.",1
man i fucking hate talking to people because i just feel disgusted with myself for being a waste of space and not being able to hold a conversation i hate having friends / knowing people because they give me so much anxiety and worry that theyre all gonna gang up on me and make my life miserable,1
"I have good faith now that I am going in an upwards direction with my life and my ambitions, but financially I'm kinda fucked at the moment. Financial shit is what got me out of the cheapest university that I could go into, and it's what's keeping me from even going to community at the moment. I feel like I was doing everything right, and that I've been wronged, but I don't feel like a snowflake. I feel the exact opposite. I am going in tomorrow to work at mcdonalds while I try to get a job over at the niche mom and pop restaurant near my house. I have job experience and I'm not unemployed, thank god for that, but I'm just feeling depressed and reminiscing about my past and what I could've changed about it, although, there was little room for it. Sometimes it makes me feel liberated feeling like I regret nothing for having dealt with and going to deal with rough shit, but the feeling remains that nobody will ever take me seriously and I fucked up. I just need to vent all of this in a healthy way. If any of you are fans of cowboy bebop, was listening to [this song](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WKnVaDwUg5s) earlier while I reminisced.",0
"I hate the way i look. I always imagine myself as myself, but way better. I hate my breasts they look fkn huge (But they look average sometimes which is good) I hate my shitty stomach that sticks out too much, I hate my fat arms, I hate everything about my face but I specifically hate my face shape, nose, lips and forehead. My jawline used to be so nice and prominent before I got braces, but now it's ruined. I'm sick of people commenting on my looks. Whenever i try to feel better about myself, someone rips me down. I hate the way i look. I want to get a breast reduction but I don't have money. I am going to the gym but I feel like nothing is happening because I don't feel pain the next morning no matter how much I work out. As for my face, my braces are coming off soon and my teeth are still getting fixed so there is some hope. But I don't look the way i want to. It's so unfair my parents have good features and faces, whereas I don't. I hate the way i look. This is why I have very low self esteem and another reason why I'm depressed. I hated how I looked for a very long time. I'm 17 and I think i have body dysmorphia disorder. I fixate on everything and constantly look at the mirror at my flaws. It sucks. Things did get better I'm not going to lie but I'm still not happy.",1
I find that I never really trust my own opinion I'm always seeking validation from others. I can't do anything on my own because I never feel like I'm capable of doing things by myself.,1
"So I would like to say when it started but my memory is of no use, since I only remember a few things, it is not short term memory though (it's not that bad), apparently it has do with my brain only remembering thing it thinks important. Any way, I am not depressed but many of you guys have similar problems based on some posts I have seen. Here is my reasoning behind this feeling, most people I know or have met when I was smaller said I was really charismatic, outgoing, etc but that I changed all of a sudden what I can guess was when I was around 6-7 based in the few memories I have. I became serious with out any sign of change and now I don't care about anything, but mean absolutely anything it is what can only be described as ""detached"". It could have been from suppression of who I am since that age because of people having expectations for me resulting in me not developing any real hobbies/interests and knowing how to express my likes/dislikes or due to some other events that led me to suppress myself. Anyway that's my guess but I still don't know why I don't care anymore and how to move forward.",1

"Hello, Ive fallen into depression again a few months ago and it got really bad a month and a half-ish ago so i went back to therapy. I went to see the psychiatrist who prescribed me meds. Im on remergon as anti-depressant, akton for anxiety and Zopiclone Teva + ergytonyl for insomnia and nightmares. Ive started taking them two weeks ago. Now my question: does any of you have experience with taking those meds while smoking weed? I have not smoked any since i started my meds, but im thinking about maybe having a joint when i get home (im abroad for the holidays). Would that be a bad idea? I know that alcohol can interfere with the effect, dont know what weed will do tho and im way too anxious to just try it. Any opinions on the matter are welcome. Thanks!",0

"I'm currently going through some hard times and have no emotion towards it. I have ME (mialgic ensephilomitis), ME makes you become very tired very quickly to the extent that at times it even inhibits the ability to properly think. I have other issues but that's the main one. it first started in the middle of my freshman year, I'm now a junior. Because of it my doctors have removed me from any school and I'm to tired to do most things. This has made it as if I have been frozen in time while the rest of world continues forward without me. At first this was heartbreaking and I went through depression, however during that time I always thought that my emotions were not nearly as strong as a normal person's would be in this situation. Since then I have stoped being depressed but have also stopped feeling emotion towards my situation completely, both positive, negative and even neutral emotions, I just don't feel. I have also started finding it very difficult if not downright impossible to feel empathy towards others, or any other emotion for that matter and I have been left with only logical reasoning -when I have the energy to properly think- to an extent. So I am wondering if my lack of emotion is normal or not? Is there anything I can do about it because it feels very unnatural.",0
"I have Asperger's Syndrome...it makes understanding social cues, empathizing with others (IE understanding why you made someone upset), and social interaction in general very difficult. When compounded with existing depression, it makes me feel profoundly isolated sometimes. Things have been looking up somewhat recently - I graduated college and am currently looking for a full-time job - but the fact that I will always struggle with this disorder and find it difficult to interact with others makes me profoundly sad. A relationship seems impossible, as does sex. I don't mind living by myself and have tried to come to peace with it, but being a round peg in a world of square holes does get to you sometimes. Things can get better for me, but nobody else will know about it.",0
"Lately I've been panicking over the realization that I'm dumb as a brick, and I haven't achieved anything in my life. I'm 20 years old and just got my first girlfriend. I guess this is the only major achievement of my life, as she is beautiful and smart. Amazed we actually connected. I constantly have a feeling she's going to leave me due to the fact I can't keep up with her. She has achieved so much. Scholarships, awards, friends, and more. I did nothing in my life. My teen years were spent playing videogames. I did anything and everything I could to waste time and make my life go by faster, because I assumed I'd be happier when I got older. Unfortunately I've realized that I should have used that time to train my brain and focus on grades/academic achievements. Now I'm as dumb as a brick. I have no career direction. I don't think I'd ever be able to work in a field that makes serious money. I still don't have any friends other than one online friend, and my girlfriend ( who has many real life friends ). I've never had any real life friends. I don't know what to do. My brain is already fucked. My memory is so bad. I feel like I've lost the ability to learn. Once she realized I'm destined for failure, she's going to leave me. Then I'll be truly alone again. She already knows I'm not smart. ( not sure why this hasn't scared her off yet ) I can't take it. I hate feeling inadequate all the time.",1
"When I was a kid I loved to write little short stories and draw random stuff, wherever my mind was inspired to go. Now I‚Äôm 20 and thanks to depression it feels like my mind can‚Äôt digest anything. A movie or TV show might be really interesting every now and then, or a song might spark some emotional response, but then 5 minutes later I pick up a pen and everything I know about creativity goes down the drain. I just feel empty. I hate it. I wish I were a kid again, where I would be excited to create anything that comes to mind. Nothing‚Äôs up there. How do I get my imagination to ever work again?",0

I see why I stay away from social media. I made a decision that probably made him view me as a creep. I created an instagram account, and tried to post some jokes, because I wanted him to think I was funny. It was my attempt at communication, under disguise. It was stupid in retrospect and I won't ever do it again. But honestly, I want to know what I can do to fix this, because I don't want him to view me in a weird way.

I think that people who are depressed can be grouped into two general categories. Those who have been unfortunately mentally wired wrong and those who have experienced some awful trauma or emotional pain. I'm sure for many on this sub it is both. For me it is both. And because of this fact I am uncertain if I can ever recover. I feel as though it is inevitable that I will kill myself. There is a part of me that really doesn't want to; i'm scared. But there are also times that I feel so badly and I just want it to end. Has anyone out there found anything that's helped them? Right now I just don't know what to do.,0

"My life isn't getting better, albeit I'm very young I really just dream of a point in the future that things are just working out in my favor for once. I hear about people hitting their rock bottoms and finally making a change that leads them to a much better version of themselves. I imagine myself progressively doing worse and worse things until I reach my rock bottom. That scares me because I have been doing worse and worse things and I don't want to hit that rock bottom anytime soon, I just want to change.",1
"I was with a bunch of friends on new years and i wasn‚Äôt looking forward to the rest of the party, let alone the coming of a whole new year filled with depression, anxiety, all the things that come with it etc. i started to get into my depressed mood at around 10pm on NYE but i decided i was gonna try to go into 2018 with no regrets. As a little backstory in a junior in high school, it may sound a little silly but i‚Äôve been in love with this girl (who also is my best friend, been indirectly friendzoned more times than i‚Äôd like to admit) since about freshman year. i finally built up the courage to tell her that i have feelings for her. She told me that the feeling was mutual and it just made my entire night. i‚Äôve had a smile on my face for 24 hours and i‚Äôm just so happy with life because of this. Just something i wanted to say because it‚Äôs all i‚Äôve been thinking about. I‚Äôm not going to sit here and say that ‚Äúeverything gets better in time‚Äù or anything like that for multiple reasons, but just know that something small can make your day :)",0

"I am curious to know why someone would help me here, but let's go, I used to be a very happy and pleasant person, at some point I became a negative person and a little depressive, I believe that due to the death of my grandmother (she always took care of me and I only realized how important she was when I lost her), because of this I think I felt guilty and started to see things more negatively, after that everything started to get worse in my life, even When I feel I'm happy, it's for a brief moment. I do not know if it is part of growing up and getting older or if I have some kind of problem, so I wanted some help, even if it was words or situations where someone also lost an important person and somehow managed to continue to live",0
"ive lost it all, my will to live is gone and i just feel really numb at this point i hope this year kills me",0
"Basically, I developed a really big crush on this girl. It was the only time I've ever seen my self being in a relationship. And get this! She had a crush on me too! I was so happy. I was going to ask her out last night at a NYE party, it's the only reason I went. But I missed my chance. Whatever, I'm hanging out with her and some other people tomorrow, I'll ask her then. Never-fucking-mind. I got a text from her a couple hours ago. She said she just wanted to be friends. I respected her, I didn't want to be a creep like a guy from r/incels. I told her I got it. I didn't get it. She liked me last night. I know she did. And today she didn't. I don't get now feelings for a person could come and go like that. The worst part? One text from a girl destroyed ever bit of progress I've made to better myself since November. I've been feeling good, maybe happy since then. I've been doing good, been free of self harm. Until today. The only thing that could get my mind of her was pain. I have to hang out with her and my friends tomorrow. They are probably going to see my fresh cuts. I just want to be clear, I still want to be her friend. But I still have a crush on her, despite what she made me do. All my old coping mechanisms didn't work. I can't get her out of my head. I can't stop thinking of it'd be different if I asked her out last night.",0
"Every day just feels the same, get up, go to school or go to work, get home, go to sleep, wash rinse repeat. Im feeling drained, depressed, and overwhelmingly bored. I have a few hobbies and a few friends, but the only thing that brings me comfort is sleep. I know i've probably experienced only a portion of what this life has to offer, but the rest will probably disappoint me anyway.",0
"I am so fucking terrified. Im scared of myself. Im scared of other people. Im just scared in general. My therapist might tell my parents about my past cutting (Ive avoided it for over a month just so i have proof that I ""stopped""). Im so scared that shes going to tell them and Im going to have to deal with it. If she does I would probably just have a panic attack right then and there. This is something that I JUST CANT deal with. My mum controls me when she is scared for me and if she finds out I dont know what would happen. Maybe ill just kill myself. Probably not but I cant imagine anything after she tells them. I want to cut so badly right now SO BADLY. I cant though because I need to prove that I dont do it anymore.",0
"My life is OK. I've got most aspects under control and other than a void inside of me my emotions are most often under control as well. I feel like I can rationally look at the world My problem is I'm so bored of everyday life and routine and there's really no way out of it, it's how society is built. The purpose of our modern lives is to sell our hours to some company and get money in return mostly so we can buy stuff we don't really need. Any sense of community or responsibility is gone I can read a book, play video games or something but eventually I realize it's just mindless escapism and I feel bad about spending so much time on it.",0
"Whatever you want to talk about I‚Äôll talk about. Long lost love, struggles of everyday life, anything. Here‚Äôs my story: I have been struggling with depression and anxiety for 15 years. I have cut out friends and some extended family because I don‚Äôt want to be hurt anymore. I isolated myself so much I am ruining my life. I have wronged others, badly. I feel terrible about that. I have stopped talking to someone who was pretty much a soul mate/twin flame..if you believe in that.. no other words to explain it. (I hate the word soul mate)Currently in a slightly toxic relationship where I am not heard and not really given the opportunity to discuss things in detail. This is because they do not have the capacity to have a deep conversation, and also their phone takes precedence over living human beings. I also do not have a ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù and this bothers me to no end. Can you relate? Let‚Äôs hear your story.",0
"Hey I‚Äôve been depressed for almost 3 years now and in the process of doing so I‚Äôve failed almost all of my college classes and am being dismissed. I can barely get out of bed, shower, eat, take meds, etc. My only saving grace as a human is that I still work full time. Any advice anyone can give me? Or encouragement? Or literally anything I‚Äôm so empty inside I don‚Äôt even want to help myself anymore. I feel so self destructive. A notification of any kind would be appreciated. I hope you guys had a good new year.",0
I miss some of my ex gfs but all of them ghosted me.. I hate my job .. I cant stand living with my dad.. Im afraid to apply to any developer jobs or show my skills off to employers..I dont even have a car rn... I just feel like a failure..Im really lonely.. I feel like everything is getting worse and worse.. maybe I should start taking anti depressant medication..,0

"Let‚Äôs say someone makes it through a very difficult chapter in their life. Or they make it through their whole life with bad luck,bad coincidences and overall a life filled with negative feelings. Do you believe that life either gives a compensation or reward, to those who make it out alive and well?",0
"So I have depression, but generally I consider it more or less... I don't know... in remission? I was on meds and I went to therapy for a while (meds 4 years, therapy 1 year), and then I started to feel better. I felt like I had a better handle on it and it didn't really run my life anymore. Eventually I weaned off the meds (and therapy) and I felt pretty good. I graduated college, got a new job, I moved to a much better area, and I'm in a stable, loving relationship. In the past couple days, I'm starting to feel the ""depression monster"" creep back up. I'm hoping it's just post-holiday blues. I guess my basic question is, that's a thing, right? Like, it's pretty common to feel low right after the holidays? Does anyone else get that?",0
"I have this constant feeling that I am invisible to everyone else. When someone talks to me directly I feel so strange, in a good way though. I feel extremely conceited for saying this, but I want someone, anyone, to tell me to my face that they think I have some kind of redeeming quality, or something that makes me stand out. I feel ugly, dumb, and talentless all the time. I am just mediocre at best when it comes to anything. I wish that when I walked into a room, people noticed me. But they don‚Äôt, I am always a ghost or a fly on the wall, whether I want to be or not.",1

"I‚Äôve struggled with major depression since I was probably 14-15 and I‚Äôm 25 now. I‚Äôve tried several different medications and had many bad turn outs with that. I am on 200mg of Wellbutrin now and it seems to work well but every 6 months or so, I just get the fuck it‚Äôs and stop taking it. Like ‚Äúi don‚Äôt need this shit‚Äù. And then of course I‚Äôll get extremely down &amp; have many more suicidal ideations. I usually have them daily anyways. I realize I have to stop doing this, and I tell myself every single time that I won‚Äôt do it again, but I always do. Even though I am currently on an antidepressant it doesn‚Äôt make the suicidal thoughts go away. I can be having an okay day and I will still picture myself with a gun in my mouth or similar things. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever actually do anything to end my life for a few simple reasons ‚Äî my brother hung himself 4 years ago and I know how hard it was on me, my dad would be lost without me, and honestly because I have stuff in my room I wouldn‚Äôt want my parents to have to see or find (stupid I know but whatever works right). Anyways, I feel like I‚Äôm rambling but the point of my post is to see what other people do to stop these thoughts. Just looking for tips or ideas that I could try because it takes a toll on me after awhile and for fucks sake, id like to get through one whole day without thinking about offing myself. I‚Äôve tried some coping mechanisms such as journaling but I couldn‚Äôt ever stick with it.",0
"That's all I can really say. Nothing is worth the effort... I don't think I am capable of taking steps to improve my life, because I just don't even fucking care. Whatever I'm doing, wherever I go in my life, I'll find a way to be miserable. Why try... I just... ugh...",1
"I don't want help. I don't want to get better. I don't want to be happy. I don't want to be sad. I don't want to live. I don't want to die. I don't want love. I don't want to feel like I ""deserve"" to be ""happy"". I don't want anything. I don't know what to do.",1
"I woke up this morning after going to a New Years party last night with people that I genuinely call my closest friends sad and alone. I love my friends but they don't know the real me. I feel like I'm always acting when I'm with them, trying to make them happy and desperately trying to make sure I never lose the one thing that keeps going, them. My depression has turned me into an actress and I don't know how to keep going.",0
"I'll just cut to the chase. I'm very depressed and not entirely sure why. I have a lot of stress and trauma so I think that contributes to it but I really can't point to one thing. I am only happy when I'm with a select two people. Neither of which I see often so I end up very depressed when I'm not with them. I'm good at masking it while I'm with people but as soon as I'm alone it hurts so much. I used to think that taking my life seemed completely abstract but now it just seems closer to reality. However, I know I would never because I have a lot to live for and a lot of people care about me. But I just need some way to get rid of the pain. I can't see a therapist reguarly due to complicated reasons. I was curious about anti depressants I don't know much about them but I just need some way to not be sad all the time.",0
"Whether I have consciously or unconsciously pushed people away, I am now here alone. Questions cloud my mind such as will I ever be the person that I once was? Will I ever feel some sort of acceptance from myself and from others? Will all of this become too much and I end up killing myself because of it? Ive started to self destruct and I am now drinking almost everyday. I cry because I dont know what else to do and there seems to be no hope left. I feel stuck and I know that this cant last much longer. Its been about a decade now and time is ticking.",1

I shouldn't care but I do because I still love her. I never stopped.,0
I've called my best friend with best wishes on New year eve. We're living 8hs ride from each other and we see very rarely. Anyway when I called him he told me I saved his life becasue he was about to kill himself. I'm depressed for 6 years and after therapy AND on meds myself but there is one major differece between us. He was(Is) drug additct i was not. Im calling him every single minute I can get. And here's my question. How can i convince him into rehab/further therapy? He's also on meds but they dont seem to work because of drugs. Ps. Hope you're all safe and making progress. Pss English is not my native langueage,0
Not trying to sound like a post from Incels but I really wish I could find a girl that would like me back. I just feel so lonely sometimes and I just want someone to get close to and share the things I find amazing with. And on a more selfish note just having the validation and confidence booster in that I'm actually able to get a living breathing human to be interested in me for more than just friendship.,0
"It's been one hell of a time these past 5ish months and lately, my depression has been kicking my butt. I finally took my two sons out again. After way too long of nothing but Christmas events, a NYE BBQ and birthday dinner. I took us to one of my favourite places to go. There's few people (especially when it's not school holidays), there's loads of wildlife around and plenty of seats so you can rest frequently (important when you have small kids). And it feels good. I'm exhausted. Sore feet and legs, a bit dehydrated and sunburnt, but still better. I also have a few photos to show for it, which is always good.",0
"I need help. My mom said that I used to be happy, just for the sake of being happy. I can't even remember when that was. Every time I try to talk about my issues, I end up asking the same questions over and over, borderline asking people to shower me with complements and reminders of my good qualities. My mother is annoyed to no end by this. I don't want to do the same to my friends. As stated in the title, I have lost the will to live. The timing couldn't be worse, as I'm about to start talking classes for my GED, which I will need to talk because I fucked up in high school by being lazy and not doing my homework. I don't necessarily want to commit suicide, but I feel as though I am ""at peace"". I don't care if I'm going to die anymore. Maybe at most I'll shed a tear and ask to say goodbye. But, I am not at peace, for if I were, I wouldn't have such feelings of my own insecurities and self loathing. I don't know what to do to feel better, as every time I am even the slightest bit happy, it always goes away too soon, and I miss that feeling greatly. The biggest worry right now, is my borderline nihilism, the possibility that nothing matters; there is no point. I am unsure at best about whether or not this philosophy is true. I hope dearly that it's not.",1
"I mean I see it as weak as a man standpoint but it‚Äôs comforting when it can put you to sleep getting all your emotions out and I constantly do it for the comfort I can never get from anybody else. It‚Äôs nice and puts you to ease but it seems so pathetic but I can‚Äôt stop myself from doing it, I need comfort and I need self reinsurance that I‚Äôll be okay and comforted. Is this really pathetic? I don‚Äôt think of it as a personal stand point but from self judge and trying to be generally not so weak.",1
"It sucks because a flaw about your personality can easily be fixed and I doubt it has a strong impact. Being reminded constantly of body flaws is the worse in my opinion because that can just ruin someone completely. It just hits you in the heart because that's what everyone views you as. What sucks even more is that, you can be confident in your own skin and as soon as someone points out a flaw, that thought stays with you forever and will never escape your mind. All these insecurities build up and it's just horrible.",1
"Not only did I sleep until 2, but I drove to Dairy Queen and spent $10 on fast food. I've also picked 2 new scabs into my face due to anxiety. I forced myself to play Skyrim for an hour, but grew bored rather quickly. I'm also returning to school tomorrow, which I fucking hate. (SPOILER) 2018 is as awful as 2017.",0
"I have never been diagnosed with depression or even talked to a professional about it being a possibility. But I used to think about it a lot. Especially during the last several years of my previous relationship. I felt like the worst human being because my SO was actually a wonderful person, but I couldn't bring myself to feel happy. Instead, I felt trapped. I often thought I would eventually have to consider suicide if I wanted to get out of it, but I didn't need to worry because I wasn't at that stage yet. I just cried a lot. I also grew to find self harm theraputic, but knew I wouldn't do anything 'too far'. When I did end that relationship, I did an emotional 180, which let me justify and blame all those feelings on the relationship. And up until now I believed that. I have been in my current relationship for a little less than a year and I am just starting to feel myself sink. But this time it has nothing to do with my SO. In fact, I'm terrified because I'm so invested in them and I don't want them to see me this way. I'm scared of losing them because all I can do is sit around and be a pathetic mop of a person. I know how good my life is right now so I don't want to do anything to damage it. I don't have anyone that I am comfortable opening up to with my emotional stuff. I don't know if anyone can help me try to get my head in the right place, but I would really appreciate any suggestions on how to take control of my own feelings.",1
"This has been going on for years, but it wasn't till today that I noticed it was happening. I get this sence of relief when I reach out towards people to hang out, but they tell me they can't. It happened to me today, I was home alone and craving human contact. I called my friend to see if he wanted to hang out, but he tells me that he couldn't cause he was working. I then get a sense of relief, and I'm happy for all of two seconds cause I get to stay home, but the happiness fades, and I'm back to being depressed cause I can't hang out. The opposite also happens. When my friend tells me that he can hang out, I get this feeling of dread, and I have to force myself to not cancel my plans. After we hang out, I ended up exhausted and tired, but a little bit less depressed. Am I the only one that is a mess of contradictions?",0
I'm 14 and I've been depressed since my dad died when I was 11 I've never had friends I'm unattractive never even hugged a girl I've been bullied since the 4th grade and to top it off my will probably send me to a military school I don't know what to do,1
"DAE struggle with the most trival tasks? My first thought in the morning is always: Why? Why take a shower, when I look like shit anyways. Why force myself to live in a world where I hate almost everything. I'm ALWAYS uncomfortable, Whether it's OCD, social anxiety, or self consciousness. I'm only somewhat comfortable when alone, but even then.... what am I supposed to do? Nothing interests me anymore. Is life this fucking hard for everyone else, or am I just a lazy piece of shit?",1
"In the last month I spent my birthday, Christmas, and new year entirely alone. I likely failed at least one of my exams. Almost every night I've woken up in fear from a nightmare in which my only friend dies. Two months ago was the last time I went into work and the last time I went to most of my classes. I told everyone I was too busy, but the truth is I was too anxious to leave my apartment. It felt too much like I was just failing. Three months ago is when I discovered that my depression may be caused by a chronic vitamin deficiency, which I would have been suffering from for over 10 years without knowing. A disorder that could have equally significant impact on my brain and body, which it may have already. This month I'm going to get checked to see if I'm right. If I am, then my dream career is a bust. If I'm wrong, I'm right back to square one and most likely going to end it. I'm in a lose-lose situation. The only thing keeping me going anymore is the fact that I don't know how my friend would handle it. She has big dreams that she can absolutely attain, but if she cares about me even a fraction as much as I care about her then coping with my death could ruin everything. Yet at the same time my presence in her life has been a fairly consistent cause of stress. Another lose-lose. I don't know what to do. I can't live for myself and I can't live for her. But dying isn't an option either right now. My life is a giant Chinese finger trap.",0
The title says it all my anxiety stopped me from going down a small waterslide and yet I have the drive and courage to kill myself there must really be something fucking wrong with me,0
"A new way of self harm I've been doing is going onto /r/all , and finding posts or people I disagree with, and just argue with them for the sake of making myself miserable. I'm pretty opinionated and compassionate about certain things, and I have pretty unpopular opinions, at least for reddit, and always get into these situations where I get upset, and slowly hate myself even more. Anyone else had similar experiences?",1
"Happy new year everyone I hope u had a good time I may be alone Tonight but i wont give up yet. One day I'll be a friend to someone if not, well I got my crippling shyness it will never leave me. I feel dumb for being depressed for this but truth be told i never had a friend since i was a kid.",0
"I've suffered with Depression myself and managed to help myself out of it on my own; however, I know it's different for everyone. My brother has been to the therapy to treat his depression but he is still struggling and I don't know what to do. He always believes that there's no light at the end of the tunnel and that he'll never be happy no matter what he does. He even said he can't even take his own life because that would be to selfish of him, in other words he's only alive because he has to be for my family. You can tell him one thing to make him feel better like "" You""re not alone"" or something that is very similar to the way he feels and he will completely dismiss it. please I don't know what to do..

Now I‚Äôm having these dark thoughts for the first time in months and I just want them to go away.,0
"My first post on reddit - I just joined because I desperately need support from people who understand. I‚Äôm struggling with alcoholism, depression, anxiety, and self harm. Most days I wish some horrible accident would happen to me so I could either die or end up in a coma so my thoughts couldn‚Äôt torture me anymore. I see my counselor regularly, I‚Äôm on Zoloft and Wellbutrin, trying to work on daily meditations and CBT. But nothing seems to be working. I haven‚Äôt felt like myself in such a long time and I‚Äôm not even sure of who I was before this. Was I ever happy? Confident? Did I have goals? I wish I had something more meaningful to say, but if I keep going it‚Äôll just be a novel of negativity. I don‚Äôt really know what I can find here, but I am running out of ideas and desperately need to be reassured that I am not just another face in the crowd. It feels selfish and stupid to admit, but I need someone to tell me that my existence is significant. God, it‚Äôs embarrassing to feel so powerless and incompetent.",1
"I've been dealing with horrible anxiety and depression for the better part of 2017. I'm on a decently high dose of antidepressants now, which helped for a few months, but now I just feel like my depression is overtaking my life. I have no motivation to do anything right now. I need to clean my bedroom before I start my spring semester of school, and I don't want to just waste my break sleeping, but that's all I feel like I can do. I love to read and have been thinking about starting a blog for book reviews, which is something I'm still interested in, but I have absolutely no motivation to pick up a book or do anything except sleep or watch mindless TV. I guess I'm asking if anybody else has experienced this and if anybody has suggestions for how to get through this rut. It's so frustrating because I really do consider myself an ambitious and goal-oriented person, but the smallest things (even taking a shower or brushing my teeth) feel physically and mentally impossible at the moment.",0
"Apparently, people hate it when others talk about their suffering online. People figure if you're talking about how depressed you are on social media, you must be faking it or looking for attention. A sincere cry for help makes you an ""Attention Whore"" apparently. I hate it when people dismiss others' pain as insincere just because they posted about it on social media, and even going as far as to make jokes about it. Also, I hate people dismissing others' pain because of their age. I saw a tweet once that was like, ""If you're under 23 and claiming to be depressed, you aren't really depressed. You don't know depression until you're an adult"" or something like that, and that certainly isn't true. I knew two people, one in middle school and one in high school, that were hospitalized for weeks from suicide attempts. Please, don't assume others are making up their pain ""just for fun"" because more often than not, the person behind the screen is actually suffering. That's all. It's nearly 3:00 a.m. where I am and my depression has been hitting me rock hard lately. I figured I'd get around to posting on here sometime.",0

"I have a lot of friends that have done a lot of cool stuff. Like travelling, living abroad, for example. I grew up in a poor family and I've never got to travel much. I've never even left the country. I feel like my friends are more spoiled and had the chance to do all of these cool things at a young age. Even if they weren't spoiled, I feel like they are luckier than me in some way. I just feel bad for not have had those kinds of experiences yet in my life. I'm 23. I'm going to travel one day. It's just that as of right now, I'm sick of hearing all of their stories. I feel bad for not wanting to hear it, especially when it was such an important part of their life.",0
"I'm 17, and I fucked up real bad. Yesterday I went to a party to celebrate New Year's. I got so mad with my only friend that I told him to fuck off and that he should just forget my complete existence. When my brothers saw that they just tried to help me, and I told them too to fuck off and went outside to punch the wall until my hands started to bleed. I blocked everyone on Whatsapp, and now I'm completely alone and my family is worried. I don't know what to tell them. How do I tell them that every single day of my life is a constant pain and urge of jumping off the window? How the fuck I make them understand? I think I did the worst mistake in my whole life, and I'm afraid there's no way out. Suicide feels easier every day that passes, and now the will to do it is bigger than ever. I doubt I'll do it, but I'm starting to think my life has come to an end. That's it, I just wanted to rant. Wish you luck, and happy new year I guess.",0
"Tried a couple of them, and I'll be honest with you: I absolutely dreaded them both. I don't want to get deep into it, but one of my therapists took time during our session just to talk with someone personal on their cellphone. (Hard to believe, I know.) I've heard from a few people who have taken therapy say that you have to find the right therapist for you. But hearing that argument convinces me that I'm essentially paying people to listen to me until I find someone that says the right thing to comfort/""save"" me. Maybe it's just my brain telling me that, but it just rationalizes my personal stigma towards seeking professional help for myself.",0

It's a long story I could probably write a book... i might write a book... lol I used to struggle HEAVILY with severe anxiety and my parents would belittle it until I was having anxiety attacks and even then they said that therapists were for crazy people (my parents are very traditional and care about what others could say about you). My boyfriend was always there for me even though, at the time, my anxiety wad mainly caused by him (emotionally). He understood and was the only one who could calm me down. Post emotional shit I was also very depressed because I was disappointed in the person I became. Because morally I'm very black and white and I let my boyfriend fall in my Gray space. And that was new because I've never loved someone like I love him. He is the light of my life and existence no matter how much shit we have been through in the last 3.5y. Yoga and meditation and send awareness got me though that, mostly. Regardles... very very long story continues and I'm not used to things going well so when I have a small problem or inconvenience I react and prepare to be hit by my metaphorical truck.. Also my day could be great and I get home and my family ruins anything and everything. Sorry this is all over the place but so are my emotions.",1
"Hi all, I have been struggling with the idea of being too greedy. I mean: I have people who love me (family, friends, partners, pets), I have a job with an acceptable salary, I have hobbies. Lately I haven't been feeling competent, but I know I am good in my job, and also that I am a good, nice, kind person who cares about others. So, what do I have to complain about? Why am I not satisfied? Why do I want more? Meh.",0
"I'm a 17 years old male and I have been diagnosed with a really fucked up case of ADHD. Some years ago, I started showing all the symptoms of depression, to the point where literally everyone began to think I was depressed from what I told them. My therapist told me that it isn't depression, but then what is it? I have ALL symptoms, and I'm in a hole so deep I can't see the sun anymore. Maybe I'm desperately trying to give my problems a name I'm faking and believing a depression? Idk. I'm so confused. Any idea what this can be?",0
"Probably doesn't help that I welcomed it with coke, booze and weed.",0
"So I started therapy a couple weeks ago, and I just dont feel like it works at all. My mother drives me 30-45 minutes away, for me to sit in a couch in front of a professional, while I only say one-word sentences. My therapist suggested journaling. She said she would read them if I let her, so maybe I say it on paper and give it to her tomorrow, and hopefully I can get this mess sorted out.",0
"I had to go to a specialist doctor due to heavy inflammation and pain chronically, he asked for blood work and I have yet to go (appointment was in October). I'm not sure if I'm avoiding this because -it could all be in my head, and there's nothing physiologically wrong with me -or because I'm dying and wouldn't be as upset then the first option.... yikes.",0
"Idk sometimes I feel like I'm sorting my issues out and getting better, I feel like I am in a better state of mind but then my SO tells me I'm not changing, I'm never going to change. I start to feel lost. I start to feel like I don't belong here",0
"I admire her so much. She makes my life worth living another day. My depression is so gut-wrenching and I often find myself struggling for a will to live, but her smile is so infectious and she makes me smile in even the darkest moments. But I need to emotionally detach myself from her. She doesn't even know I exist. She lives thousands of miles away, is super succesful, and has a loved one of her own. Does anyone else emotionally attach themselves to people (like entertainers, celebrities, idols, etc.) almost as a form of escapism, but know that you'll never meet them and it hurts? I personally am a huge fan of one specific band/group member, and she makes me really happy, I'm just trying to emotionally detach myself from her because I'm afraid her group is going to disband in the near future and she's going to be out of the public eye.",0
"(18/F) My depression has been at its peak for the past two months, and I've started to notice that in addition to my fucked up sleep schedule, I haven't been eating as much. I just don't have an appetite. I'm just never hungry when I should be anymore. And it sucks, as someone who is actually trying to gain weight (I've been underweight all my life, I'm 5'4"" and only ~101 lb), it really sucks. Some days I hate my body, and as much as I try to love it and do what's best for it-- my depression won't let me.",1
"My mom is largely what keeps me here when I don't want to be. She's an amazing woman who has given me everything she had. But, for whatever fucking reason, I wish she hadn't. I wish she didn't care. I wish I could just die without destroying her, and I often resent her for it when she absolutely does not deserve it. I feel guilty and fucked up. I want to help people. I want to dedicate my life to a nonprofit that helps people with mental issues that can't afford treatment. If I died I could never achieve that goal and help those people. Yet, I often wish I wouldn't wake up. I just feel guilty and selfish.",0
"I feel like recently especially I have turned into a robot. While I cry myself to sleep occasionally, over time I've learned to deal with the pain to the point of numbness. Nowadays I feel like I don't have a reaction to anything, nothing burdens me or makes me really happy anymore. It's just always the same blank stare for me.",1
"I'm scared. Hell I am terrified. I have to go to therapy tomorrow and I am just so fucking scared. Last session I built up the confidence to tell her about past self harm and want I do to avoid it. She mentioned telling my parents and I nearly had a panic attack. I'm scared I don't want her to but I know she's going to have to sometime. I haven't done it in long enough for the scratches to heal and all that's left is a few scars. I haven't done it so I can prove that I am ""clean"". But in reality I've been thinking for weeks about where I can cut where no one will know. I want it so badly but I'm also so scared for my parents to find out. If they do.i would probably want to die. Wish to be hit in the face by a fucking brick. I'm scared.",0
"I struggle with clinical depression, anxiety, and now I think I have PTSD. I moved a way for school and I had a hard time adjusting to this new life and making friends. Dated a guy in this new city and we broke up a few days ago. He is my fucking roommate (yes I know bad fucking idea). Dealing with all this, I fell back into a depression and I decided that today I will go back to the hospital and get back on meds. I‚Äôm tired of the constant shaking feeling, the panic attacks, the tears, not being able to sleep, not being able to eat. I‚Äôm tired of feeling like I‚Äôm always in danger. I just cant do this by myself anymore and I‚Äôm gonna try and get help as soon as I can. I want to feel better and I know these feelings aren‚Äôt forever.",0
"Hey anyone that would like to offer some advice, I just turned 16, a little backstory to help understand me My relationship with my dad is dysfunctional, (he‚Äôs really like bipolar and makes everything my fault somehow) I have pretty much had to stand up and fend for myself all my life, the only person that did those things and helped me out (grandad) died 3 or 4 years ago. I actually go to pretty good school, pretty talented in athletics (football mostly), I don‚Äôt have very much money like 98% of the other kids in y school, and because of the amount of wealthy kids teachers are always making kids feel guilty for being white, so even tho sell drugs to help pay for myself, my moms rent, bills and tho we live in a violent neighborhood and I‚Äôm part of that crime my mom still tries to tell me I‚Äôm just a preppy kid (cuz of my school I guess, and she doesn‚Äôt kno where I get the money from) Everyone acts I‚Äôm supposed to feel guilty and get that everyday, I‚Äôm pretty funny guy and really talented football player but like I said the rich kids won‚Äôt have over the broke boy but we‚Äôll sure be friends with him at school!! All these tests have told me I have severe anxiety and am moderately or severely depressed. I just don‚Äôt kno what to do, I feel really shitty for a lot of my life and can‚Äôt sleep at night, idk if there‚Äôs anything I can do about my situations that I guess are the cause of my ‚Äúmental problems‚Äù",0
"I have such intense flashbacks about the trauma I had through therapy and being held at a hospital where the staff were horrible to the patients, I break down crying. I feel like I'm living it all over again and it's impossible to break out of until the flashback ends How do I handle these? It feels so real at the time and it stops me doing day to day things at the time it happens I'm not going back into therapy before anyone suggests that, and I'm already on anti depressants",0
"I was in acute care for a week last month and I‚Äôm looking at going somewhere for a longer term stay. Unfortunately the state I live in doesn‚Äôt have ANY residential care for my age group and if I‚Äôm going to have to go to another state then I‚Äôm going to go somewhere that I‚Äôll enjoy at least. I realize that you can go to a mental facility in New Jersey if you live in New York, that‚Äôs simply a state line. I‚Äôm more curious to know if I lived in say, Georgia, if I could go somewhere in say, California or if that‚Äôs frowned upon. Thanks.",0
"I've always felt like emotions are hard for me, I always smile but thats just to make other people feel at ease around me. when something bad happens I rarely cry, I do feel aching in my heart and know that its sad I just don't feel like crying is the right way to react. Is this something you have felt? How do you get along with it? TLDR. I know emotions and know when I should be doing them but i cannot cry when I'm sad and I rarely laugh when I'm happy",0
Is it normal to think about killing yourself a lot but being too scared to ever do it? Maybe I'm on the wrong forum I know but I guess I started out over here just feeling sad again.,0
"Got into an argument with my partner a couple days ago and haven‚Äôt stopped thinking about it. I have severe depression, not medicated because i don‚Äôt have insurance, but I see a volunteer therapist every couple weeks. I live with my partner, we‚Äôve been together for a little over a year. Partner is getting depressed because they feel like all they do is make me feel better. I feel so selfish because I can‚Äôt help them help me. I feel worthless and like a burden and I just wish I could find the motivation to get out of bed in the morning without bothering them. How do I help myself, so my partner won‚Äôt resent me in a few years? I‚Äôm so afraid of losing them because of my mental illness",1

"I've talked with her for over a year. I developed feelings for her I haven't developed for anyone else ever. but recently she said she moved on, which I assumed was just her going through an episode that her many mental illnesses can bring out. But today I found out she's dating someone who makes YouTube commentary videos. The worst part about it is their relationship is long distance. She told me the only reason her and I never dated officially and stayed together was because she couldn't handle long distance relationships. but yet this dickhead is farther away than I was. I was always there and I poured my heart and soul into her so she'd be happy. I just don't understand why I'm not good enough. Where I went wrong I'm fine with dying tonight. I prayed to god or jesus or whoever to kill me in my sleep tonight. I begged for it. If we had hard alcohol or crazy pills at the house I'd down those. I've accepted that death is a peaceful out for life, so it's what i wanna do to be happy. I just wanna forget about her. Forget about the memories. Forget about all the plans we made to hang out and do so much shit this next summer when I flew over there to see her. It really sucks. I hate myself. I hate the YouTube commentator. I hate her. I hate that I'm still living, shaking and crying over this revelation",1
"I myself am clean from self-harming for almost 3 years. When I used to harm myself, I would do it in places no one could ever see, if it didn't work I used makeup to conceal even the smallest marks.However my friend's story is rather different. I saw my friends cuts on his arm, some weeks they are worse, some better. The marks of cuts and bruises are extremely visible since he often wears T shirts. Once I shared my battle with depression and self-harming, thinking that maybe he will open a little bit but it didn't happen. All I know from him is that he has troubles controlling his emotions and uses hurting himself as means of gaining control over the negative feelings. The thing is 1. I don't know how to react (should I ignore the fresh marks as if they weren't there and go on talking whatever?? Or should I bring it up?) 2. Should I suggest him seeing a professional? I always offer my own help but he never asks for it...",0
"The world is covered in snow Today's holiday I am still alone This morning, she handed over the city We've been dying spots on a white stump Good reason for laughing without too much color When thoughts go far from here To save the world I have no idea And everything eventually covered the snow Like I was here, she was here Someone like me was here before us Someone like me was here Someone like us, here after us All is covered in the snow Missing you to take me high Who surrendered the city a long time ago We're always on ice and everything's fine Good reason for laughing in a day without numbers What remains the same when you leave here To save the world I have no idea And everything eventually covered the snow Like I was here, she was here Someone like me was here before us Someone like me was here Someone like us, here after us..",0

"I was taking 40mg Celexa for Anxiety disorder. It wasn't working so well so my Psychiatrist put me on Effexor. Here was his tapering off plan: 1st week: 30mg Celexa &amp; 37.5 Effexor 2nd &amp; 3rd week: 20mg Celexa &amp; 75mg effexor 4th week: 10mg Celexa &amp; 150mg Effexor 5th week: Psychiatrist appointment Now, i'm on week 3 taking 20mg Celexa &amp; 75mg Effexor and i'm starting to get very depressed. I am not having suicidal thoughts and if i did i would go straight to the ER. But i am having depression. So my question is, should i keep on pushing through ? Go back to 30mg Celexa &amp; 37.5mg Effexor ? Start 10mg Celexa (Maybe stay on 20mg) &amp; 150mg Effexor a couple days early to get a higher dose of Effexor in my system ? It's strange because my anxiety hasn't been bad since starting. The reason i'm asking here is that my psychiatrist is on holidays and i dont see him until mid January. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks",0
"I'll try keep it brief. My younger sister and I have a good relationship, but she's never really talked to me about depression and her apparent anxiety. I recently got to know she's weekly been visiting the nurse practitioner at her school, and she called our family the other day. My sister apparently has struggled a long time with anxiety, and there's some talk about suicidal thoughts as well. I got to know this through my mom just now. I've read through the talking tips under this sub, but I'm unsure how to deal with this. I have been good at lone-wolfing myself, and never really been depressed, but I'm a good listener. I don't want to start talking to her directly about the issues either, but I'm certain she haven't tried hiding going to the nurse either (she writes appointments on her calendar in her room)",0
"It's difficult to describe how I feel really because I have no reason to be depressed at all but I am! When I wake up in the morning I'm so disappointed that morning has arrived and i have to live through another day, I try to go back to sleep so I don't have to face the feelings I have! I don't want to burden everyone with my depression and be the one that people avoid because I'm always miserable and low. I'm anxious all the time and don't know how to control this, anxious about the smallest things that other people do each day with ease. Taking a train or a plane can trigger anxiety days and days before and make me feel so low. These feelings I cannot control and really wish I could. I came off my anti-depressants last year and now I'm thinking of going back on them but really don't want to. All the time I feel I'm going round and round in circles with such a heavy load!! Does anyone have any ways of dealing with such feelings?",0

"I feel like depression and anger are linked, and I'm poorly dealing with both. At my worst, I feel like I want to fight or insult others, which is obviously not the way to go.

"Depression it‚Äôs a bitch. Its like there is a constant voice in your head telling you that you are worthless, pathetic, useless, a failure, a disappointment that you dont deserve happiness or to be alive but to only feel pain. It makes you feel like you are forever trapped in an abyss with no way of crawling out. Sometimes you can see the light at the end of the tunnel but it always drags you back deeper than you‚Äôve gone before and the impossible cycle of escaping begins again. No matter how much you try to escape the darkness, your brain yearns for the dark thoughts to return because it happens so frequently that it becomes the comfort zone for it. You begin to doubt everything about yourself; telling yourself whatever you do isnt good enough and you should just stop trying or its worthless to just go on and might be better to just end it all. You feel like you are nothing and will be important to anyone ever and when you are gone everyone will be happier knowing the pathetic failure that they once knew will be gone forever and can no longer fuck up their lives. All the smiles on the outside is just a mask to cover how you really feel. You cut because you feel like you deserve the sharp stinging sensation as the blade cuts your arm open and the blood slowing oozing out. Afterwards you are left with scars as a constant reminder of the pain you cause others and how worthless you are.",1

"I don't really want to die, or rather I don't have any reason to and I want to not want to die, but I still know that probably in the next 5-10 years I'll just do it. I won't make some long post here, I won't call for help or show any major signs, I probably won't even give/have a good reason, I just know that one day I'm going to wake up and go throughout my day like normal, and then just jump off the roof or hang myself or something. The older I get the less in control of my own thoughts I feel, but I also feel like I have a better understanding of them. I can see how people can just go crazy and seemingly snap and start killing people or hijack a bus or start just running around naked or something, and if anything I'm lucky enough to know that I have no urge to harm others and would do anything to save someone that isn't myself, but I just feel the need to off myself and I know that eventually it'll just happen. Lately I've noticed myself getting into a lot more dangerous situations I think maybe because I feel a need to have control over my own death, and that getting in random fights with junkies on the subway and getting hit by cars when chasing the bus excites me because my life (or death) isn't in my control. I don't know maybe I'm the only one that feels this way but I wanted to see if anyone else had any similar experiences or tips with how to feel less trapped by my own depression.",0

"I'm 18 and have never really been able to make any friends. I spent this new year alone again.

My parents met and started going out when they were younger than me and I'm still a virgin. My ssris don't cure my loneliness and only help in a superficial, enough energy to get out of bed sort of way. Idk why I'm posting this but I really just want to die, I have since I was 11 and have thought about it just about every day since I was around 13. I just don't see anything to look forward to in life. Every day I wake up and force myself to go to the gym, then sit around all day trying to find something good to watch or get enough energy to do something productive, then lie in bed and can never fall asleep within 6 hours. Even youtube sucks now. I'm so sleep deprived and lonely, hopefully I'll just die from a heart attack or a stroke or something.

I also overhead someone say ""but anon is the only single person here, which i didn't really want spelled out to everyone. The only thing i'm thinking of right now is this and if maybe there's a bus that leaves for my city soon and jump on it without telling anyone. So i don't want to do now, other than eat and drink myself to sleep, with the others. I'm not bitching that ""waah, give gf now, waah"", it's just that I don't like being made fun of for this reason.

"So I don‚Äôt know for sure that I am depressed, but it really does feel like it. I dont feel loved or cared about. Like I am not special, I am nobody's favorite person. But I know this isn‚Äôt true. My family loves me very much. My mom, dad, sister, they all care for me so much, and I can tell. I don‚Äôt necessarily have feelings that strong for them, but I have never felt very strongly about anyone. Does that make me wrong? To feel so unloved even though they do?

"Turns out no self-esteem for years really ruins your life. Due to this I developed major and chronic depression. Know exactly what I need to do, can't do it. You don't just rebuild self-esteem over days, weeks, months, or even years. This takes decades. Decades of kindness, decades of acceptance, decades of love. It's real hard to get that as someone who feels like every breath is robbing another of oxygen. Pretty sure it's game over for my mental health. Oh well. Maybe I can learn to live without these things but 4+ years of trying make me weary, y'know. Anyways my life sucks, your life might suck, but supposedly life in general doesn't suck.

That something being music, specifically Metal and Dungeon Synth. I've also gathered a bit of energy and motivation and can hopefully use that to lose weight and learn some instruments.

"I'm 30 and have been depressed since 15, the age at which I realized I wasn't going to be tall and handsome and gave up on life. I get worse whenever I see porn, since I chastise myself for not having the genetics to date and bang hot women. I asked an aesthetics forum to rate pictures of me, they said 6-7, but it means almost nothing to me if it's not 9. The one thing that keeps me from killing myself is thinking about how I could change my life around. I'm currently selling my stuff so I can afford lasik, then braces to fix my teeth. I'd also love to get limb lengthening on my legs by 3"" to make me about 6', but I have a small head and worry that I won't look good. I've done research on how to apply for gene therapy clinical trials and other radical reconstruction. I honestly don't care what the complications would be, I'm THAT unhappy. I think about suicide already, and I would end it if it happened to not work out. I wasted a lot of time before realizing this ""my way or bust"" mindset, and I hope anyone younger than me can take away that you'll regret not solving your problems sooner if you don't start now. The depression only compounds on itself as you grow older. I'm 30, and I'm willing to put my DNA in a blender.",1

I wondered if the love in my chest surfaced by this natural beauty was reciprocal in your heart somewhere.. though on second thoughts I guessed resentment might occupy most of our space there facilitated by my loathing and misery. Take it as obsession, ill-health, whatever, I can't walk around on a broken leg with a smile on my face. I went in boots and all, young and blind as they come.. Here's a thought: Perhaps staring at your weaknesses in crippling shame and regret is more likely to preserve the good in you than perpetuate failure over and over again, if you manage to recover in time.. That's a relieving thought I guess.. I remember when we fell in love.. I was so stupid. More words.. Just words... There's no one else.. Not that it matters.. Back to exciting sentences followed by exclamation marks and smiley faces..",0
I feel that I‚Äôm stuck to this pain. My anxiety gives me so much suffering. I can‚Äôt control it. I cannot afford the medicine. I cannot ever be truly happy.

I'm hurting.",0

"My family loves me. I'm only 17. I have a couple of close friends. I'm not broke, my house has heat, I have a Nintendo Switch. I laugh... I was fine until I saw this girl. ""Speak to her."" Hah! Thanks, but it's never so easy. She's plagued my mind, she's all I think about. She's destroying my mind and she doesn't even know me. I see her every single day. All I do is dwell. Dwell she's not mine. It's my own fault. I'm the one who stays quiet. Well, she does too, of course, but I think you catch my drift. I was fine. Now I'm not. I'm literally losing my fucking mind. Abusing disgusting amounts of various vile medications provided by my father's prescriptions. I've noticed a difference in my brain since I've touched those pills. I'm actually losing it. Anxiety. Depression. Insanity. Bipolar. Lost in a pitch black labyrinth called ""Life"". Therapist is nice but, talking about your fever won't cure it. Fuck Zoloft, Prozac, you name it, fuck it. My mind is becoming like a messy room. On the verge of a noose. Is this the end? Is this life? Am I done for? We ask these questions. Redundancy.",0

"Just to give some background, I've felt pretty depressed for most of my adult/adolescent life (I'm 21 now) but have never felt able to talk to anyone about it (not even family or close friends). I have days where I'm in a slightly more positive mood, but generally I just feel pretty apathetic about everything, lethargic and extremely self-critical to the point where it stops me doing things. I don't really have physical symptoms but being this low obviously causes me to neglect my health quite a bit. My environment and lifestyle certainly have an impact; I recently moved in with my aunt who has very little understanding of depression (and just emotions generally), and I'm living in a place where I don't really know anyone. Anyway I took an NHS depression self-assessment recently and the results suggested that I should go and see my GP. However, I'm seriously doubting whether to do it, I feel like I'd just be a waste of their time. Besides I know that there's a chance that they might suggest taking anti-depressants, and I'm a little reluctant about that given everything that I've heard and read about them and their side effects. Sorry for the long post, guess I just needed to vent, but any advice would be really appreciated.",1

"Hi, My parents love me, unconditionally, they want the best for me, they have sacrificed a lot for me to come to where I am now, I got a high score in my final exams and I want to become a politician, but my parents won't let me because of the ""sins"" that will be committed, I am religious, the reason I want to become a politician is because my native culture is DYING in my country, the my culture is part of the majority ethnic group, our ethnic group's culture is being wiped off, the government stopped teaching my country's history so children become less patriotic, the police are corrupted, and many more atrocities are committed by the government. It is my dream, but if I ditch my parents I would want to kill myself, I would not be able to hold in the guilt. My dad also believes that if the elders of the party order you to do something and you don't do it, because it is not moral or just plain stupid,they will kick you off the party, can't I just create my own party?

"And instead of enjoying the break, I want to be here less. I had maybe one hour of reflection all week where I felt grateful for this job. Grateful to be making $30k out of college. But then I fell asleep and was back it by morning. How working full time @ 24 won't allow me to survive on my own. Who am I kidding...making more money wouldn't let me survive on my own cause I'd still be depressed. Unable to adult and pay bills or do groceries or fix my house up.",0
"Everything has just gone pear shaped. I had a great year on the whole, things really started to look up until they came crashing down. My mental state has been in decline for a few months and it's finally culminating in the destruction of everything good in my life. 2018 is shaping up to be utter dog shite. I can't even tell the story, it is so complicated and spans over 3 years. It's all becoming too much and I really just want out. I don't even want to end it all, I just want to start again. I'm about to lose my girlfriend and that feels like the final straw. I walked out to the bridge last night, I really wanted to do it but on the way I talked myself out of it. It felt like as I walked there I left the reality that was torturing me and then as I approached my house on the way back, all the anxiety and fear and pain started to kick back in. I just got back in and cried for hours. My just-about-still girlfriend spoke to me and managed to level me. Today I'm back to square one where I think she's going to leave me, I can tell she wants and she should after that way I've treated her recently. I took my problems out on her and treated her terribly. I'm getting my just deserts. When she leaves me, I'll fail my exams, drop out and who knows. I don't know how I'm going to cope. My life was once so good.",0
"Don't get me wrong, I'm not suicidal. I'm far too cowardly to actually kill myself. I'm just tired of existing. I just wish there was some way I could just stop existing, without actually having to kill myself. I'm sad all the time, and I'm sick of it. I'm sick of pretending to be okay, because if I don't then I get accused of attention seeking. I can't stand being alive anymore. I'm tired, mentally and physically, and I don't know how to handle it anymore. Edit: Thank you so much to everyone who commented with advice and offers to listen. It means so much to me and, I'm sure, so many others who feel the same way. To all those who commented saying they relate and talking about feeling suicidal, I'm not a certified therapist, but I'm willing to listen if you want to talk about it. I'm just a PM away to anyone who wants to talk. I'll listen. Thank you all for making me feel less alone, and slightly more normal for a while.",0

My parents only keep me around so I can attend college but if I don't I'm out. I just want to quit, and attend college full time and have a social life because i still have so many hours to complete to be even close to getting a degree. My depression just gets to me because i'm unhappy and stressed with no social life whats so ever and I want it back. My parents want me to work both full-time and attend college full time but i just can't. I really don't know what i should do, should i leave my job and accept my parents being disappointed over giving up such a good paying job just to achieve my dreams, or give up my social life and college dreams just for a Full benefit job and work throughout my 20's.",0

Due to some schedule mishaps, I missed taking my meds on a reg day basis and I felt the same off of them as I do on them. I'm back on them to therapeutic level and nothing. I get moments of excitement but they fade away into the background. I can't think of one thing that I'm happy about. The only really thing I care about is my job. That's it. I do it very well.

Thats how my depression is..Its always in the core of my body, but I muster up all the energy I have within to try and act how I'm ""supposed"" to act: Social, happy, positive, hard working. Today I feel as if I can't muster up that energy. I feel like if I go outside today and put on that show that I put on everyday, I might break down. It is effecting my work. I can't tell you how many times I have called out for being ""sick"" I feel like I need time off to get on medication and see a therapist regular to talk through these times. Has anyone else had to deal with depression and needing time off of work? Should I just explain to my manager exactly what is going on? He knows I get into depressive episodes like this and has been sympathetic before. I enjoy my job I just mentally feel depleted right now.

"Hi all fellow friends who are suffering from depression! I have IBS, suffer from sleep paralysis almost every single night, be a paranoiac. To add to that, I had bone fractures which forced me to go through 2 painful surgeries over the span of 3 years (the first one to add a fixation device to my bone and the second one to remove it). The amount of antibiotics and painkillers I used only makes all the symptoms I have much worse. Sometimes I feel like I am the most unfortunate person in this world. And as a result, the fact that I have all these symptoms in my 20s when all my friends around me are super healthy makes me suffer from depression as well. Things have been hard for me for a few years. I don't want to go out and meet strangers and spend most of my time in my room. However, a new year has come and I am determined to regain control over my life. I don't want to give in to these diseases that easily. I am too young and I have to support my family as well. I have maintained a habit doing exercises everyday for 2 weeks (running and hitting the gym). Now I want to start reading to understand more about all the aspects of mental health. I would be much grateful if you guys can recommend any books you think would be of great help to a person fighting mental illness. Tks for reading and sharing!",1
"Besides my therapist, the only person I really open up to in a serious way is my best friend. Only one out of my tons of friends. For everyone else, I only talk about depression in a comedic manner, making jokes about it and laughing. I do that because I feel I‚Äôm supposed to be the fun one in the group, and while I think I am (I always make them and myself laugh), if I get super serious they‚Äôll either make fun of me, stop being my friend, or get super worried and tell someone. I don‚Äôt want any of those to happen. Anyway, back to my best friend. Since she‚Äôs the one I‚Äôm serious with, I constantly talk to her about things that bother me, my true feelings, and how suicidal I am. I‚Äôm starting to feel like I‚Äôm being a nuisance, constantly talking to her about these dark things. She doesn‚Äôt need to hear all of that. She pities me, as do all of my other friends. I really don‚Äôt want to annoy her with how much I‚Äôve been telling her. Recently, she even said that she feels very depressed, and she‚Äôs been talking to me about it. She never mentioned me doing anything to make her feel like that, but I feel like I was a part in it. My texts probably affected her a lot. It hurts to think that, but I feel that‚Äôs the truth.

"I hate to sound like *that guy*, but does anyone here receive any professional help? I went through this shit phase once, but I've got my shit all cleared up now. Yeah, I'm still alone or whatever, but I've learned to accept it while discovering a chemical imbalance in my brain from a trusted psychologist. I mean, with this generation it's like 50% are angsty teens, upset over simple things who glorify this shit then there's another 50% who seriously suffer. Who are mentally ill. It bothers me that this sub even exists, knowing there are so many people who need help, turning to an inappropriate source. I understand a support group, but I've yet to see anything empowering here. Just shit that'll make even the sanest, happiest person kill their fucking self. I suggest opening completely up to someone with a degree and credentials to aid you, not a bunch of kids on the internet. There could be something seriously screwed in your psyche and you may need medication or another form of treatment. There are also infections/diseases (and types of cancer, even) that can cause severe depression and addictions in people. Most don't find out 'til too late, when it spreads or whatever.

I tried my best to explain it and how it was effecting me (when I could pull myself together). They were very kind and understanding, but it didn‚Äôt change anything. They don‚Äôt want me there. They sent me home to think about it, and they‚Äôre having an HR rep call me later to discuss my options. I worked for a hospital, so they‚Äôre also having Behavioral (mental) Health call me as well.

Most of my old ""best mates"" pretend we never knew each other in the first place. Everyone who I loved don't care about me. I went from being the happiest kid on the planet, to now a loser that no one talks to. I am so haunted by this experience, it's hard for me to socially interact with anyone.

Is there a better life ahead? How does it feel to have the life sucked out of you? The realization of my dead childhood dog of 15 years hits me. My heart starts to hurt.

I don't even fucking know. Am I crazy? What is this shit? What is this shit? I don't care, fuck it. That's like my catchphrase nowadays. Fuck it. I don't care. I'm in Hell. Is any of this even real? Is it all in my head? What the fuck. I am very upset. I don't want any more of this. What the fuck is my life. My girlfriend reckons I'm doing really well and everything is hunky dory. I don't want to tell her that it's going back to how it was. It will always go back to how it was. This is how it is. This is how it will always be. Fuck it. I don't care about me. That's what I always say. If she ever wants out I'd be fine with it. I love her to fucking bits but I want her to be happy more than I want me to be happy. That's all I want. I gotta do this fucking shit again for another year. And then for God knows how many years after that. I don't want to do it. I don't want to live. Just got off the phone with a lady from the Samaritans. Felt like a fucking idiot. I'm so stupid. Am I crazy? Is this real? I'm sorry.",1
"Has anyone just been relaxing one moment and then all of a sudden you want to punch a wall or kick something over? Sometimes its so violent or sudden that my hand/foot jerks and it I have to physically restrain myself. In public I can cover it up with a sneeze or something, but its disconcerting. There are also times when I'd be trying to draw then all of a sudden I just exit the application without saving or tear the paper in half, only to regret it .5 seconds later. Most of the time I'm usually either numb or kinda content but then suddenly my chest wells up and shit like this happens and I have no clue why.

"It started seven years ago, just some muscle aches, swelling, with a dull pain, which I pretended was better after some ibuprofen, but it persisted. For years now I‚Äôve dealt with that, but dull pain is way easier to deal with. I‚Äôve always had bad ankles but starting about two years ago my ankles get sharp pains when I‚Äôm less stable, I‚Äôm fine otherwise and I use a cane to take some weight off. Other than some weird looks I get, (I‚Äôm under 30) it helps a lot. Last year I started getting a similar sharp pain in my left eye, followed by intense light sensitivity. Does anyone else get similar somatic symptoms?",0
"PSA: when someone takes their life, the wrong thing to do is reach out to their closest friends asking for explanations surrounding their depression and general mental state. You certainly DO NOT state that you wish the deceased had reached out to their friends. NEWSFLASH: THEY WISH THAT TOO! This is not a time to point fingers, dig for answers, or to share just how much this has hurt you (I'm talking to you -- the people who have met my friend once or twice) -- especially over social media. Depression isn't simple. It is not brought on by having a few bad days at work. It is not remedied by a change of scenery, a phone call, or a quick trip to the doctors. The people who were closest to the deceased are not here to console you. Life is not about you. It is about the people who surround you. It is a time to celebrate the persons life who has passed, reflect inward, and reach out to those who are in your life and ask for what they might need.",0

"I got in two car-totaling wrecks in the final two weeks of 2018. Firstly, I rear-ended someone hard enough to total my mother's car (it was still completely drivable but FUCK ME, right Geico? :); this happened the 19th. Then, I got a rental. And took my girlfriend of two years out to dinner on NYE, because that's our anniversary date. Silly me. Someone t-boned my rental car at 55-60 mph and completely destroyed both cars. Thank the fucking lord no one involved sustained any serious injuries, but me and my girlfriend are in pain and quite frankly, while I'm glad she's alive and ultimately okay, I wish I was dead. I'm on the hook for some serious fucking cash right now. I don't want to do this but I know I have to. For everyone else I've just been putting aside my fear and pain and anguish and self-doubt and I've been putting it into my work, finding extra hours and working for bonus etc. Hopefully I'll find a way out of this. Sorry for rambling. I don't want to tell this to anyone else. They just won't listen because both the accidents were my fault, so maybe I really am just a shit driver despite an otherwise squeaky-clean driving record of four years. I don't know what sign the lord, should he exist, is trying to send me. Maybe it's just to stay off of the road.",0
"All that I've been able to feel is beginning to turn into feeling nothingness. Even when depressed there are still ups and downs but now I am starting to just feel nothing. Blandness. Stale. Everything devoid of any meaning really at all. I'm not suicidal and I don't self-harm. There's just no motivation to accomplish anything and I can't really see the point of anything. I find myself staring at things and thinking about nothing, whereas my mind used to spend a lot of time thinking about everything. Does anyone else feel like this? Sometimes, like now, I realize it's happening and it makes me feel worse to know it's happening but sometimes it really doesn't even bother me because sometimes feeling nothing can be better than feeling anything, ya know? I don't know.",0
"I'm 19, F and I absolutely hate my parents. They are the worst. All my mom does is take out her anger on me and criticize me. She is extremely judgemental in every single aspect that relates to me. But they treat my brother like he is the golden child. He sexually abused me and let his friends do it too. He can not to do anything wrong. My parents are ready to buy him a brand new car, but won't let me have gas money for the car that's already at home. My parents honestly treat my brother with so much love and support and it breaks my heart to see them treat me like I'm some unwanted part of their life. They have told me multiple times that I should grateful because they feed me and provide for my education, like that isn't the responsibility of parents? They make it seem like it's a great and big deal that I'm not abandoned. They treat me like a slave and I get in trouble if I don't do anything they tell me to do. I honestly hate every single moment I stay at home. My parents and my brother always gang up on me and ruin my mood constantly. I have seriously considered suicide in the past to get away from this hell and I still live with them. But I have realised that is too easy for them. I don't want to end my life because of some assholes. I'm gonna study my ass off, get a good job enough to allow me to live on my own and never look back again.",0
"I've always loved helping others, whether it means I'm there to talk to them and listen to their concerns, or doing something for them. It makes me feel like I'm contributing something to society, and it is especially rewarding to see when I've helped make their day better somehow. However, lately I've been feeling this is my only good quality, being a utility to others. People only keep me around and talk to me because they know I would always agree to helping them out. They tolerate all my other horrible qualities because the help is worth more to them. Recently, I sent an email to my boss (who I'm pretty close with) with an organized spreadsheet for a work task (something I had not been asked to do, and was my boss's job), and they replied telling me ""You're amazing! Thanks for making everything so organized for me. You are such a gem"". Comments that like sting for me rather than lift me up because they just further validate my belief that I am only a utility to others, and that if I weren't useful, they would ice me out in a second. I still try to do helpful things for others, but lately it's made me feel more horrible than good.",1
Im so fucked. I have anxiety to the point i feel i have paranoia and it leads to depression. And i just wanna be normal for once. I wanna actually live. Instead of constantly think about the bad about myself and how horrible i am. What can help me? Therapy? Meds? Can you guys help me out?,1

But I don't wanna die, because I known a giant love (took 2 years to forget, with some souvenirs coming over sometms), worth it to suffer for that; and because dying is as usefull as putting a hair in the street. So, I'm blocked in a useless, never stopping suffering circle, because of the demotivating thing keeping me from completing something. So Help Me God. (Oh well, I don't believe in any god.

"I've almost failed 3 classes the past 3 school years, and I'm on the brink of failing another one.

I so badly want a relationship but I am starting to wonder if I'm capable of having a healthy one. -I have this sneaking suspicion that at some point I won't be able to keep going. I've been so close to quitting several times and have barely pulled myself up but then it's all happened again. -I am unable to foster healthy relationships with friends or otherwise. I've been in therapy off and on for years and still can't do it. I know everyone is busy, but please, it would really help me to know that there are other people out there.

"I've been on therapy and taking meds (Lexapro 10 mg). I've been having less mood swings, it's easier to sleep and I don't have crying breakdowns anymore. Still, when I think about death or not existing anymore, it seems like such a comforting thought, like a relief from all my pain and fears - even thought it's been less hard to deal with them, it's still hard. I don't think about it all the time, but when I do, the idea of no existence feels very tempting. When I wake up, I always ended up sleeping again or just staying more in bed. Even if I get out of bed and have an ok day and all, I still hesitate to do so, because hiding from the world in my bed feels like the best choice as a first thought, when I have just waken up. But it's still a better place than I was before, so I guess I've got that going for me. Better than nothing.",0
"I do. But I gotta do it again, it's been awhile. Basically: 1.) Horrible genetics. Parents shouldn't have bred. I have several life threatening issues that my parents ignored the obvious early signs of, so my life is severely shortened. And I can barely walk. (No real solution for this one. Besides, you know, ending things myself before I become trapped in my body.) 2.) Shitty in-laws. It's VERY bad. Spent almost a decade patiently convincing my SO that they hate him. Because they do. (Either I keep trying to convince him to stop feeling obligated for people who mistreat him ..or I leave.) 3.) Poverty level. (Randomly succeed at life and afford to live WOW SO EASY AMIRITE. My solution is to keep leaving below my means. Start gambling safely and see what extra money I can come up with.) 4.) No dependable friends. I talk to people easily. Most suck. Most enjoy suffering and pity points. I want people around me where we all want to SOLVE our depression/etc. (Keep trying to establish long-term friendship with people. It's basically endless, time-consuming shopping that we all have to do.) I've been depressed for about 20 years now. I'm pretty good at distracting myself and finding happiness in the tiniest things.

""You have everything, you have no reason to be depressed"" those words are what got me to fall deeper. Nonetheless, I thought having my bf would be another solution and ya he was trying but now he is being so cold and saying he feels suffocated.

""Im sorry im depressed"" ""I feel guilty being a depressed gf"" ""R u tired of me"" ""I will stop talking about my depression if it makes ends meet and just be together...i am scared and dont wanna be alone"" I hate how everyone tosses me like im a strong thing but im so fragile. I am a coward to even be suicidal, cause of course I dont feel like its the solution. But to not exist...I often think about it. I wanna escape im so tired of feeling like I cause burden to ppl and my bf is giving up...my parents dont understand...im running out of options and breaking down. And all drs want is to put medication after medication and I'm done. I hate how i have to understand how ppl react to my depression when they should understand me. How fucked up is that.??

"I can't bring myself to enjoy anything social anymore. I can't be around my family because I'm sick of faking my happiness, I can't be with my friends because they don't realise the extent of my depression and I always bum them out by being too anxious to say anything. While I was planning my death a month ago, I got a message from my friend telling me she's getting a house with her boyfriend and I'm invited to her party, I was so shaken up that I didn't know how to respond and said ""cool I should be able to come"". I then deeply upset her for not congratulating her and she instantly started saying I was being a bad friend. She's aware that the girl I've liked for years is attending this party with her boyfriend (which is obviously extremely uncomfortable) but she told me to suck it up for one night so she can enjoy herself but... I just can't any longer, I'm sick of pretending I'm fine for the sake of others. So in the end me and this friend have fallen out ever since and I've decided I'm not going to this party for my own sake, I get the feeling that this will upset her but I just cant endure any more of this torment. I've had 2 suicide attempts ever since this happened a month ago and I'm scared I might try again if she messages me telling me I'm a bad friend. I just can't deal with any of this any longer, I can't be what people want me to be any longer... And it's not me being a bad friend, it's me being depressed and wanting to live.",0

I don't even remember what it's like to be happy. I don't want to be happy. I **want** to be unhappy. That's all I have, the ability to not need the thing that most people want so much, that they dedicate their entire life to get it.

It's exhausting trying with little progress, often regressing back to a state of depression. I'm so tired of people getting bored of me, sometimes it takes a week, sometimes a month, sometimes a year. Eventually everyone gets bored (and the few who aren't bored of me, they are always so busy). Don't get me wrong, I do have a bunch of brilliant friends, who are fantastic to hang out with. I do genuinely believe they enjoy my company, but when I'm down and want to talk to them they don't want to know. They push me away when I need them most. I really want a long hug, not just a quick one to say hello or goodbye. Even better to snuggle up in front of a movie with someone and just for an hour or so feel embraced and less broken. And yet I constantly feel detached from all of this, I get moments where I feel like I am inside this body but not connected to it. I feel distant from all those around me. Then theres the confidence issue, I've always had some problems with confidence. Sure I'm great at being outwardly confident should I be at work sorting problems out, or in charge of a bunch of people whist running an event. I can take the lead when I have to. But on a relational level my confidence lacks so much, be it with friends or romantically.",0

I don't have anymore friends irl, basically dumped all real life friends because I'm sick of being ""the one that people goes to just because they have no one else, and dumps me the instant they find company"", and basically judgemental friends in general. I only have some online friends who keep me alive. I'm basically almost dead inside. Yesterday, I was talking to a new online acquaintance i met. He kept telling to me to change, he kept forcing his ideals on me. Yeah, if it was that easy to change the neurological pathways in my brain, I would have done so a long time ago. It doesn't make it easy that irl I have so many factors making me feel so damn stressed all the time. I'm sick of people telling me ""you should think positive"", ""It'll get better"". It never does.

I didn‚Äôt sleep very well last night and I returned to work after several days off and it has thoroughly and completely exhausted me. I did want to share something that I read last night that I have thought about ever since I read it. I started his book The Noonday Demon last night in order to properly understand my own struggles with depression. His article Anatomy of Melancholy (http://andrewsolomon.com/articles/anatomy-of-melancholy/) he wrote in 1999 for The New Yorker in which he talks about his own personal battles with depression have made him a huge advocate for depression and is very informative. Andrew also has done a couple of TED talks. My personal favorite of his can be found here (https://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_solomon_depression_the_secret_we_share).,0
"For years leading up to this point, I had been eating healthy, exercising, I had friends and was doing well in my life, had no major health problems. I almost never get sick (even now). I'm comically healthy. All my vitamin levels are good. At the start of this crisis, my doctor raved about my amazing cholesterol numbers, thyroid was good etc. etc. So, It doesn't correlate to events in my life, or to my ""actual"" feelings, or to my physical health. So why did I get cripplingly depressed all of a sudden? The brief period where I was exposed to just a little too much lead as a kid? When I fell on my head and got a crack in my skull at age 2? My parents don't eat that healthy and I didn't start eating right until my teens. I have psoriasis so technically I have an inflammatory disease. Is it one of these things?? What went wrong for me to be otherwise so successful, but suddenly want to die? Why does no one know what causes depression??????? For those with inexplicable depression, what's your favorite theory?",0

Today is my birthday, I am alone with no one at home, because all my friends can afford to go for trips. I got three birthday wishes, My parents and a close friend. I do think about suicide, but i am not going to do it, I have worked too hard to throw it all away. I am a good hardworking guy who means well. Sometimes, when i see my peers who cheated on tests work for companies like Amazon, I wonder to myself, if I should also get a chance at happiness.

"I don't see how it's supposed to help me feel or think any better. I already know that the way I think about things causes me to be depressed, but somehow I'm okay with it. It's difficult to explain. I AM my thoughts, and my thoughts aren't irrational. I'm not depressed because my ""brain is lying to me"". Why do I sit around not doing anything? Because at my core, I don't feel an intrinsic desire to actually do something that doesn't bring me immediate physical pleasure. I don't reap the intangible rewards of completing goals or learning new things. I just don't care for it. That's a fact. I guess you could chalk me up to a whining child since I clearly don't want to push myself out of the mental rut, and with that I would agree. My values don't exist anymore. I'm a shell of a person and I don't care enough to change that. That's the thing everyone who wants to help just doesn't understand. They can't help me due to philosophical reasons. There's not a thing anyone could tell me that would make me feel as if anything mattered. There's not a thing I could tell myself to change that either. I could mechanically flip the switch on that thought so to speak, but I wouldn't FEEL it. Going with it trying to fake it till I DO feel it doesn't work because it's not GENUINE. That's the thing about major depression. It is a rational reaction and it is a genuine reaction. When someone comes out of it, they don't become ""themselves"" again; they were always themselves. They were able to flip the switch and FEEL it. This, I cannot do, and not because I think I can't.",0

Even if there is one out there that works for me, it could takes years of trial and error before I find it. So, I'm just wondering what other people's experience with meds is.

"I‚Äôve been having lucid dreams due to the side effects of my meds and I‚Äôm finding it hard to cope with them. I talked to my doctor and he told me to try taking them in the morning instead of at night but that hasn‚Äôt really helped. I also asked him for sleeping pills and they didn‚Äôt help either. In fact, they made things worse as I woke up right after from a nightmare and I found myself grabbing onto the bedsheets like I was grabbing onto something from my dream. I don‚Äôt remember what it was but it was the first and last time I took them. Going to sleep is no longer the comfort it once was. Even though I get plenty of sleep I wake up feeling mentally drained, and because these lucid dreams make it seems like I was awake and dealing with real life situations that tend to be stressful and unpleasant it‚Äôs like I wasn‚Äôt really asleep. Physically I‚Äôm well rested but mentally I‚Äôm not. Idk if that makes sense but I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy because in my dreams I sometimes ‚Äúwake up‚Äù and think everything is normal but then previous events from the dream come back and it‚Äôs so confusing. Then when I really wake up it takes me a minute to actually realize it was all just a dream and it‚Äôs messed up. I told my doc and he said most of the antidepressants have similar side effects and that‚Äôs kinda made me miserable. I don‚Äôt wanna trade my sanity just to stop being depressed. I‚Äôm honestly thinking about stopping meds again. Idk anymore.",0
"I have been taking Wellbutrin XL of varying doses since 2012. Within the last nine months, I‚Äôve begun feeling like my blood sugar is low all the time, and I‚Äôve stopped exercising because I felt like I was going to pass out afterward. Some days it‚Äôs much worse than others. Numbness and tingling are part of it. My psychiatrist is cutting my dosage in half to see if the Wellbutrin is the culprit. Has anyone else experienced this? It has been very upsetting to not feel good enough to exercise, but I‚Äôm worried about reducing my dosage. Wellbutrin is the medicine that brought me back from feeling suicidal in college.",0
"Long story short: In december I talked to my mother about how I feel and that I currently don't get my shit together; Mainly work. She asked whether it's ok if my family would know (If they asked questions after christmas etc) and I told her it would be ok. First thing she did was going to my aunt and telling her and now my whole family knows and everyone is super protective and sending help, which is exactely what I don't need. When I critizied her, she started the whole ""everything I do is wrong""-bullshit and now even my father called me, who is currently in hospital because of his weak heart and told me I should start using my brain. While I'm writing this my mother sits crying in the kitchen after she told me that she can't deal with this whole current situation and that I ""don't live alone on this planet"". I do the fuck not know how to deal with this shit either. Getting drunk now. Thx for reading.",0
"I talked to someone at the hospital a couple of years ago when i was on the edge of killing myself but i was to tired to meet up so i acted like i had gotten much better and so i did not have to visit anymore. But after a break down this fall i have been convinced i need to try it again so i will. I am depressed but i dont know why, no clue, i just dont like living at all, its just not for me, and it makes me sad. But thats it, how can that be cured?",0
....and now that escape from reality makes me feel a little closer to normal i spent the first 32 years of my life never experiencing depression but now i wonder if i did and i just wasnt bad enough that videogames wouldn't alleviate it completely. I don't understand myself anymore.,0
"So, there's this podcaster/YouTuber I stumbled upon, and in one of his recent videos, the topic of suicide comes up. In the video, he speaks about all the suicidal messages he recieves from people all around the world who listen/watch him. As he goes on, it gets harder for him to talk about it, and it reaches the point where he breaks down, where just describing the messages puts him in tears, as you can tell how much he cares for these people and how much he can empathise with them. But, I just don't understand it. As much as I try to get it, I can't. Why do people weep for us? Why do they care so much? Why do they spend so much time and resources helping us get better? And with 7.6 billion other happy souls out there, why should one or two lives even matter? TLDR: I just don't understand why people would help and care for others so much, even when there's nothing in it for them?",0
"My partner and I recently moved across country. I was doing so well up until now. No homesickness, not even really upset about leaving, found a job, trying to make friends. Then I wake up one morning and can't stop crying. Pull myself together and go to work. Next morning same thing. Just super emotional but also numb inside. I'm lonely and I feel like I can't even really talk about it. I'm supposed to be having this huge life adventure and I just wake up crying all the time. Don't know what to do.",0
"So I am locked in my room with my parents calling me a moron and idiot from outside screaming at me and im begging to be left alone just pleading to be alone and they won‚Äôt let me. I was able to tell my therapist last week for the first time in my life that I was happy. The first time in 2 years I was able to honestly say I was happy. I was prescribed adderall and it suppressed my emotions and helped me see things logically, but my anti drug parents take it away and give it back randomly. Recently my mom took it away right after I ended a relationship with my best friend that I have known for 14 years. I have multiple suicide notes and have failed 2 attempts to overdose. This is the worst Ive been in a long time and I really need some help right now. Thank you. Edit: This is my first time posting on here and the response and genuine care is amazing. Thank you so much.",0
"I'm really into computers and gaming and shit, I have a 4k pc setup that's probably ~$3,000. 250 games, probably about 1,000 movies, 70,000 songs, nice speaker setup, studio headphones, you get the idea. I've loved this shit my entire life and in the last week I've realized that I don't even play games any more. Steam shows 0.0 hours played the last 2 weeks. I don't watch Netflix, I maybe listen to like 10 songs in a day, I used to have it on all the time. I basically just sit on Reddit refreshing the page hoping to see a news article that makes me think for .0001 seconds. I've been trying to hang out with my friends who are back in town for the holidays but I'm super fucking negative. All the stuff I would say in a conversation would be tearing down a person or an idea. My ""top 3"" friends leave today, tomorrow, and Friday. I'm gonna be stuck in a room with an entertainment system I don't even want to use. An entertainment system that I built specifically to keep me occupied because nothing else would. I thought I was drinking because I didn't care but now I realize I cared about recognizing my indifference. I really don't give a shit now. I was smoking weed whenever I got a chance. I don't even want to be high any more. I'm getting increasingly worried that my girlfriend sees me as a burden. She's the only other person I really talk to. She cares about me and goes out of her way to help me as much as she can, but you can only do that for so long, right? I feel hollow.",0
"I don't want to write a long story to don't make it boring for you. Let's just say that I don't think that i'm worth living here. Im tired of my own life. First I'm so ugly and don't tell me that everyone is beautiful because i literally am ugly. A lot of people told me that straight to myself. I care about my health but i can't do anything with my ugly face. Second i'm not good at anything and in school i'm the one to joke about. My friend left me week ago because i was boring for her. Its really hard for me because she was the only one who cared about me. I have a lot of passions and sens of humor but who actually cares? I have also difficult family. They arent loving and supporting me, because i don't want to do in my life what they wanted me to and im so hopeless. I want to kill my self couse no one needs me and i'm hurting here. I'm thinking about it for so long. I wanted to write it, maybe someone will notice me. I feel so lonely and hopeless. I know that you'll probably think that i'm complaining and i'm selfish and that i'm a kid that doesn't know anything about life. (couse i'm 16) . I also want to apologize for my english, because it's not my native language and i'm still learning. Sorry for taking your time and thanks for everything.",1
"I really consider suicide, i really have no strength to fix things. I keep crying all the time because I'm so hopeless! I just want to end it forever. It's so hard to keep my happy face. I don't see the point of living this way, I want out...",0
I have just written 5 notes to my best friends and one for my family. I felt it was needed I take stupid amounts of drugs and alcohol because I don't care anymore I'm resigned that I will take my life through suicide or accidental overdose. I don't know why I'm writing this I just needed to vent really. I hope in some way something will change but my bipolar is just getting worse and worse and I am not strong enough to fight it anymore. I hope all of you find the help you can and even though I probably don't even know any of you personally I love you all.,0

I have been in the service industry in one capacity or another my whole working life, so being around people is a thing I can do, be sociable or charming or whatever, but so frequently I start to feel shitty while I'm alone. I feel bad about decisions I make, feelings I have, the place I am in life. I want someone to talk to and tell me I'm not a fuck up, but I don't want to admit things to people I know. I have a wonderful girlfriend, who is understanding and kind and non judgmental, but I don't know what to say to her, or anyone really. Frequently I can just shove the bad feelings away, but somehow I feel like ignoring them isn't healthy, but embracing/acknowledging them feels like crap too. I don't know. I'm just tired of it.",0

"Hello! I've struggled with depression and anxiety for a while now but more so anxiety. Depression was very random and I could usually find the trigger. However, for the past month I have felt HORRIBLE. I feel so disassociated with everyone and everything. Usually if I have a few drinks, I can easily socialize and have fun. But now, no matter what, I don't care what people are saying, not do I care to even engage in conversation. Even with close friends! When I try to act ""normal"" it seems forced and I often go ""blank."" I feel like I have to force myself to laugh or seem happy in situations that would usually bring me joy. I feel like I almost induce it myself. Ever since this started about a month ago, I'm so scared I'm going to feel bad, that I start feeling bad. My brain always wins. If I let one negative thought creep in, my entire mood changes and I can't seem to change it back to positive like I used to be able to do. What is this feeling? Have you been able to overcome it? I used to have fun and be the life of the party. Now I can't even force it... it seems so unnatural. Please help. Living isn't what it used to be...",0

Since this is the way it has been for my entire life, I have long ago accepted this and not really worried about it but I knew I was missing out on a lot, especially stuff like house parties, etc... But at this point I am pretty much over it and I would be happy enough if I ever had a girl, but that seems like an impossible task also.",0

Everything about it is awful but it sucks having no money. All these companies want is a little bitch and it's hard for me to take it like normies.

As if being pushed around all over the place and treated as a 3rd dish is what I deserve that is according to their point of view. Though I'm exhausted of being treated this way, maybe it's because I'm such a good person all the time. It seems that I have a tag in my back reading ""Do what you want with me, I will always be there to recieve your shit with open arms, no side effects"". I'm fucking tired of being treated as a mattress where they can lay in when the world fails them. It seems that my being doesn't inspire to be treated seriously and I'm not worth a thing. Maybe I need to be less of a good person, I really don't know, but I'm starting to think that I should scream all the swear words that I can imagine even if this makes me look as the enemy.",1

"My high school career wasnt the best but it certainly was full of great memories and long term friendships *(some of which I am still in contact with over a decade later)*. Whenever I go through old pictures or Facebook posts/messages from my high school days, I instantly feel sad and depressed because of how much fun those days were and that I can never re-live those amazing days ever again. What makes this feeling worse is that I've lost contact with many of my close high school friends so even if I wanted to get in contact with them again, it couldnt happen. Some I know have moved to different cities/countries and some now have families and established careers and im just sitting here going through old memories wishing that I could re-live those days.

"When I am in the midst of hell, crippling, debilitating depression (much like now) I always repeat one line from a song called ""Mamma Sed"" by Puscifer over and over again. It doesnt help at first, but the more time that passes the more sense it starts to make. Here is the lyric: ""Momma said, like the rain, this too shall pass. Like a kidney stone, this too shall pass."" I just love it because the cliche saying ""like the rain this too shall pass"" doesn't exactly capture what we go through in times like these. But ""like a kidney stone"" sums it up just perfectly. What you are experiencing is going to hurt like FUCKING HELL. It will be one of the most painful things you will ever go through...but...it will pass. Everybody in this sub...don't give up...we shall win through, no matter the cost!",0

On the right, is a cute birthday card that my little brother made for me.

I'm not a person to talk about my feelings, since it mostly worsen my depression. Like it does now. I feel so bad, but I pretend like I don't remember infront of the others. My friends think it was the alcohol, I guess. But it was just a side-effect, comparing to the true reason, which is, that 2017 was one of my worse years by now. I always thought, it will get better, I can stand this and become better at controlling it. But I haven't calculated failure and so I'm thrown back years.

Tomorrow I‚Äôm going to follow up on the schedule I‚Äôve set myself up with and study... be productive. I‚Äôm still not sure if I‚Äôm depressed or just going through a small phase of the blues. Maybe it‚Äôs just really mild.. but then who doesn‚Äôt have depression then?",0
"I had a good run, there was positivity. But unfortunately, the negatives became too much. Succumbed to alcohol, failing college and getting kicked out my dorm. I don't know where else to go, truthfully. I feel like such a massive waste of space. Wasted my parents money on this dorm. Wasted their money on school. I've just hit a lower point than ever before. I don't have high hopes anymore. I just wake up and go through the motions. Every day is just another day I got to get through. I don't really know what to expect, from anything.",1
"I really wanted to join the national guard last year. I‚Äôd gone to therapy for depression in the past and I‚Äôve recently went back. My recruiter told me it should be okay (I haven‚Äôt been officially diagnosed), but if I go on meds I won‚Äôt have a chance. I got a 96 on my ASVAB and was looking forward to being a human intel collector(since I qualified). Lately my depression has gotten worse to the point where some days I can‚Äôt get out of bed. Now I‚Äôm thinking of starting medication but I don‚Äôt want to rule out the guard. It‚Äôs the the only thing I was looking forward to besides getting a fresh start at college. At the same time, I keep telling myself that a depressed anxious fuck up like me won‚Äôt be an aid to the country anyway. I‚Äôm just not sure what to do anymore. Thinking about the future makes me feel even worse. I know that the things I‚Äôm looking forward to could be meaningless and I could still be miserable. It really bums me out.",0
"Hey everyone. First time poster. I've had depression for about 11 years now. I wanted to know if any of you with chronic depression have also experienced this... Now that I am a bit older and have had the illness for so long, I'm kinda more just okay with it? Like I used to get more triggered and depressed simply because I was self-aware that I had an illness, but now that's gone. Is this just another symptom of apathy? Or is it possible to live my life comfortable and aware that I have a mental health problem?",0
"New Year's Day. What a way to start the year, right? I've spent the last few weeks, maybe months feeling worthless and sad and wanting to die but not wanting to kill myself, so I fantasized about getting into an accident and dying in a way that looked like it wasn't on my own hands. I got out of the car with just some whiplash and some bruises but I'm fine otherwise. It's a miracle I'm alive right now. I spun out on the freeway going 75 mph. I got hit by another car. The witnesses and patrol officer and the EMT all expected me to be unconscious or way more badly hurt than I was. I don't believe in God, but I do think there was a greater force at work, telling me to stop fantasizing about something so horrible and to get my shit together. So I'm going to. Phone calls give me anxiety, I know I'm going to have a bout of PTSD related to driving, I'm going to feel guilty about wrecking my parents' car, but I'm okay. Everything is okay. Sometimes a wake up call like this is what you need to get better mentally.",1
"Hi guys, long time reader first time poster here. A year ago I moved into an apartment in a brand new city. I remember being so excited for all the things I'd be able to do. I'd get a job, get to a gym membership, and even join a few social groups. Well, after a year, nothings really changed. I applied for a lot of jobs and ended up going to a decent number of interviews. Nothing ever came of them and after June passed me by I lost my nerve to even really look anymore. I did end up getting a gym membership but I've never really used it though. I know I shouldn't procrastinate like this but I'm never able to find the energy. I haven't been able to find any groups or friends while I've been here either. I've looked but the only groups I've been able to find have been smaller groups that cater to people a lot older than I am. It's been getting harder and harder to find motivation to get out of bed or go outside for a long time now. As I don't have a car, I'd have to take the bus to go anywhere which would eat up most of my day. I haven't really been able to derive any sense or pleasure from much anything these days. I'm just letting the time pass. Next week, I'm starting university and I'd like to enjoy this time of my life. But I know that it'll probably end the same as all the years I spent at community college did, with nothing of significance happening and not making any friends.",0
"Where do I start? No friends really, because of drama. (crush drama, to be specific.) I suck at every single thing, for example, I do gaming daily but I‚Äôm still in the worst ranks after years of playing. (LoL players helloo, I‚Äôm a b2 player.) I have some online friends who are really supportive and tell me I‚Äôm smart, when I don‚Äôt really feel like it. I fail in basic stuff alot. It‚Äôs hard to explain to someone who doesn‚Äôt have the same problem.. Academically I guess I‚Äôm decent, I do get good grades, but only because I always ask for help and focus, I don‚Äôt have friends to talk with at lessons so might aswell focus. In handwork / woodwork, whatever you want to call it, the teacher asked me ‚ÄùAre you stupid or what is your problem?‚Äù also, I‚Äôm bullied in school, luckily not physically but they say annoying stuff and attack my YouTube channel and come at my house to throw stuff at the wall, and ring the bell a million times. If anyone is wondering, I‚Äôm 14 and a male. Also I‚Äôm never ever gonna commit suicide. Any opinions on what should I do? I just feel completely retarded and stupid.",0
"Rather than spending my 2018 a fat lifeless deadbeat, I finally made an appointment to inquire about anti depressants. Can you guys tell me what you've had success with? I know everyone is different but, I dread the thought of med hopping every 6 weeks with meds that don't work.",0
"I‚Äôve tried a lot of medicines over the past 2 years, even a combination of some, but ultimately I stopped taking them around September because I didn‚Äôt feel like I should have been taking as much as I was for as little result as I was getting. Things have surprisingly been going really well since I stopped medication BUT I still struggle with anxiety on a daily basis. Mostly overthinking everything and just letting my thoughts get the best of me. I have a really good dr. His son struggles with depression so he‚Äôs more familiar with mental health issues then your generic pediatrician. He‚Äôs kept me away from some of the more high risk medicines, but also takes into consideration what I have to say based on how I feel and the research I‚Äôve done. Just gathering thoughts and opinions on what‚Äôs been successful for some of y‚Äôall.",0
"This is more of a rant I suppose. I find myself too many times crying, sulking over my life and my problems. I was homless in september. I scrape every day to eat but when I sit down, I realize there's fucking children without water. So many people died in 2017, bombings, mass shootings. Trump is our god damn president. I just dig myself deeper in this pit of depression and realization that, things may get better for me but I dont know about the rest of the world. Do I try to help? Do I just let it happen like everyone around me does? Does anyone else feel so hopeless to this degree?",0
"only got an hour's worth of sleep last night because I've been too uncomfortable to sleep lately without exhausting myself into passing out, and today i felt so light (still feel nauseated and jittery sometimes, that hasn't changed haha) and generally somehow just better than I've been for the past few weeks. of course that's really the sleep deprivation making me giddy, but when ive felt sluggish for so long, highs like this like, blow my mind. i really dont want to sleep tonight, for mood swing reasons (and for schoolwork too). anyone else get an hour or two of sleep on the regular? ... really wanna invest in caffeine pills, despite the obvious negative effects of lack sleep. i really have no other way of feeling good.",0
"All I can do is feel these negative emotions, but I can‚Äôt express them. I don‚Äôt know how. It‚Äôs usually a skill that people are just born with or learn at an early age, but I didnt thanks to all the stupid things wrong with me. All I need is a long cry and I can‚Äôt even do that",1

"I have never felt so bad, I'm feeling like going to the bathroom and poisoning myself instantly since I'm finally brave enough to kill myself.

Now, I space out a lot in the middle of class, I just want to sleep all the time, and I don't work as hard as I used to. I just don't want to do anything. I pretend to be happy doing activities like bowling, amusement parks, swimming, ect but I really find happiness just playing single player video games alone. I have become a lot more quiet than usual. I don't know what my problem is, and I don't want to tell anyone I know, because they would just laugh at me.",0
"It's about other things too, but depression is a big part of it. The thing is that I've got it about 80% done, over more than a month ago. And now it's just kinda sitting there, unfinished. &amp;nbsp; I have tried to ""finish"" it, but it's just too difficult. Trying to finish the video just proves itself to be too much of a task. So I am just going to put it out as it is. &amp;nbsp; Do you guys also experience this? You start with something, and at first you are excited. But then when you are almost done you just loose the will to go forward. &amp;nbsp; Anyway, I am going to post a link here as soon as I have it uploaded. It's going to be a really good video, so I hope some of you guys would like to watch it.",0
"No one wants to be around me. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a bad person, I actually think I have a really good heart and just want to be loved. But everyone thinks I am this horrible piece of shit and I‚Äôm totally alone now. I probably should‚Äôve started posting here earlier. I‚Äôve been dealing with chronic depression since forever pretty much. My depression often manifests itself in anger. I got diagnosed with intermittent explosive disorder when I was like 18. I‚Äôm on meds now and seeing a new therapist (looking forward to our third session). So, I am trying to get better and I am optimistic. But right now I‚Äôm going through one of the darkest times ever. My last friend that I‚Äôve known for 12 years played me on New Years. He said ‚Äúdefinitely‚Äù and ‚Äú100%‚Äù to hanging out with me on New Years, I have the screen shots to prove it. But he never came, never said happy new year, didn‚Äôt apologize or anything so I just flipped out on him and I never want to talk to him again. Sometimes I think he was my only friend because he‚Äôs the only person That is a big enough piece of shit to want to hang out with me. Like misery needs company sort of thing. I am such a depressing loser piece of shit I only attract the biggest pieces of shit. And I hate myself so I hate anyone that‚Äôs around me so much. It‚Äôs horrible.

"Back in the middle of September, I [20M] tried to kill myself. Had everything sorted out, was in a good enough location, and had a loaded shotgun pressed up in my mouth. I was ready to go, and I tried for hours to just pull the damn trigger but i couldn't do it. Before this, I cried often and felt sad a lot, but nowadays I don't feel anything and have no drive to do anything. For almost two weeks I've done nothing but browse youtube and reddit for at least 12 hours a day, and I hardly ever move. Everything is just so exhausting and uninteresting. And this shit is just wearing me down. I really don't want to live anymore. I have nothing to live for anymore...no friends/relationships, not good at anything, don't really have hobbies, just nothing. I really wish I had just offed myself when I had the chance...now I'm going to have to find a new way out. Shooting myself was just too difficult...I'm definitely going to need liquor next time to push me over that final edge. I'm not strong enough to end it, but I have to.",0

I know i dont know you but i do know what you are going through. I know every morning hurts. Everyday another struggle towards the goal of no longer existing. Everyday wanting it to be over finally. I hope you keep fighting though. I hope you keep trying to live And Not living only because you dont want your death to hurt people but truly living because you want to be alive. Im not there yet and I might never be but i am going to try to keep up hope that i do. Anyone going through as much as we are deserves love and even if there is no one else there that says it know that people care. Every suicide i hurts a little because i know it could be me.

The feeling doesn't even stay, I make someone cry, then apologize for it because I start to understand what I'm doing, and then the next day I'm confused why I apologized, and rinse and repeat. The only time I feel somewhat normal is after being angry and making someone cry, because afterwards, I just can't think, my head is empty, and, it's somewhat peaceful, I don't know I remember being there for everyone when they needed help, but now?

This is arguably worse because at least I can work on my physical appearance to a degree. I try so hard to be there for people, try to be a good friend, etc. But eventually everyone just drops me anyway. I can't be myself around people because who I really am is a depressed, negative, pessimistic, hopeless, self loathing piece of shit. I can't help it, this is what you become when life and people shit all over you for years on end. So I try to be more positive, but I have to fake it because I'm naturally a depressing downer. I don't know what it is but people don't seem to ever want to stick around in my life. It seems like everyone just eventually vanishes into thin air and stops talking to me all of a sudden. This goes for relationships but it also applies to some friendships that I mistakenly believed were very close.

But, a good mother would accept her son any way that he is. My older brother is a narcissistic, arrogant asshole who I can't spend more than 3 minutes talking to before my head wants to explode because he does't actually listen to anything I ever say and still treats me like I'm 10. But guess fucking what? He's the favorite of my family. My grandpa and grandma, though they would never admit, clearly favorite him quite a lot compared to my sister, cousins and myself. Every time I go to a family dinner it's anything but family time because a huge argument always occurs at the table, which causes my grandma or aunt to get upset and cry. I don't know why they always have to argue over something. Also, I'm going to art school in the fall and nobody takes my art passion at all serious because I'm not choosing to follow the same typical conventional path as everyone else and become a lawyer/doctor/teacher or something similar.

"I've (31/F) struggled with depression my whole life. Grew up in an abusive home, had abusive relationships, bad marriages, etc..I've even tried committing suicide a couple of times. I've been to therapists for the better part of 30 years, and I've been on every antidepressant they could prescribe, with little positive results. It just doesn't help. I've been pretty okay for the last year or so, though. In fact, I've been happy... I started writing poetry again, and started teaching myself ASL. I felt hopeful for a future. But I've hit a low now that's lower than low. Lower than I've ever been, and my husband has basically told me to either kill myself already, check myself into a ward, or shut up. I know, it's not exactly the supportive phrase you want to hear when you're already depressed, but there it is. I'm not going to kill myself, that I know. I've got two kids, and I can't. But I find myself with this incredible urge to run away- just disappear and never come back. And I don't want to do that either, because I love my kids. I don't want to die, I just don't want to live anymore, if that makes sense... Anyway, I'm going to check myself into a psych ward, but I'm scared. I don't know what to expect. If you've ever been to one, could you please share your experience? What were you there for, how long did you stay, and did it help? Please be kind here. I can't take much more negativity right now. I just need to know what I'm in for. Thank you.",0
"Been with my boyfriend for a year now, and after getting out of an abusive relationship with my ex of 4 years. A lot happened to me, and I'm still trying to cope. Since then, I've been switching medications, weaning off, increasing, etc. My moods are all over the place, and recently I've been crying over everything. My boyfriend thinks I'm overreacting and I should move on from the sexual and emotional abuse I experienced for years. He has never understood what it's like to battle depression, and I can't find a way to show him it's more than being ""sad"" over ""stupid"" things that happened in the past. Recently, I've been diagnosed with tuberculosis, had to quit my job due to hostile work conditions, can't go back to the medical field now because of the TB, out of money and relying on my parents, I have no friends, can't make friends because everyone around here is an asshole, struggling with weight problems for the first time in my life, still trying to wrap my head around the fact I was raped, and a lot of other issues that just keep piling up. I don't know what to do. He doesn't take me seriously, which leads to arguments, which then leads to me crying, and he can't deal with crying. He says I cry too much, I need to stop letting everything bother me. Duh, I'm trying? I just want to feel like someone is there for me. I feel so alone and he's right here next to me.",0
"Been dealing with depression and anxiety for the last few years. Tried to live life normally when I‚Äôm outside my room. Friends didn‚Äôt even know I had it cause I tried the hardest to not let it affect my everyday life, even though I go through lots of anxiety attacks throughout the day. Yesterday, I just needed one break from work, first time to ever do that and was told I needed to ‚Äútoughen up‚Äù. Felt really bad about it. All these years I‚Äôve been dealing with my anxiety and depression without letting it affect my work ever, and now that i just needed a day off, I get that message.",0
I've thought about talking to someone but I can't get past the feeling that they will start to worry way too much and I don't want to be a nuisance. If I talk to either my mother or my brother they will probably force me to go back home or try to change my lifestyle somehow. Am I overthinking this? Probably. Has anyone talked about this to someone? How did it go? What measures did they take to help you? I feel like hearing some other experience about this might make it easier to do myself...,0
"Within just two days I managed to drive a close friend out with my own conflicting emotions, be hit with 4 dysphoria attacks, and continue to feel abandoned, neglected, and blatantly ignored by the people that I consider my friends. With my current home life I don't have access to therapy either and truthfully, I don't know how much that would help. I fucking hate being like this. I fucking hate having such conflicting emotions all the time, I always want to go to my friends for help but every time I try, I chicken out because I feel like I'm pressuring them, or that I'd just be even more of a burden to them. At least I still have some things to help cope, I suppose. Hooray to another shitty year of a shitty life.",0

"A friend I've met in Discord is having problems with not only his ADHD, Depression and Anxiety but with his manipulative uncle. He's living with his uncle but he can't really do anything, he yells at him, disconnects him from the internet for weeks for laughing and is one of the reasons he's depressed. I want to know what would be the best way to help him? He has already tried contacting the police but the situation seems to become worse by the week. I don't live near him (and by that i mean within a 500km radius) so I can't help him directly",0

"I'm 36 and am having a hard time keeping it together lately. I have two wonderful kids and a supportive wife but I feel depressed so much that the only way out is to just be done with it all. I have battled with depression for years. I recently was staring to ""feel"" better when I reconnected with my niece this past year. She has been battling bipolar and anxiety for years and I took the challenge to help her we got very close but she had a recent anxiety attack and has isolated herself and won't give me the time of day. It really messed me up emotionally and now I can't manage my head. I looked at her as my daughter (she's 17) and i so wanted to help her. Now it's just one more thing that I failed at in life. I just don't know what to do any longer.",0
"I actually can drive and willing to but, the freaking state jerks me around. Because oh... You went to a mental hospital for two weeks from being suicidal when you were 16! That was almost 4 years ago and, it brings me down. They tell me that I need to be medically evaluated but, I can't get a drive to get medically evaluated when everything is 30-40 miles away. I'm not going to ram a car into a person when I start driving, chill out. I would call a taxi/uber but, since I am so damn far away from everything that would cost probably around 50-100 dollars per trip. :/",0
"A close friend of mine, over the internet, told me that she was sorry. This was out of the blue, because the last time we talked we were really happy. I asked what for, and she said she broke a promise. I didn't understand, but then she said she hurt herself. I asked her why and she said she just did deserve it. I tried my best, but she just ended with ""I'm sorry"". I attempted to convince her, since I have a history with suicide attempts and depression. She said ""I can't promise anything"". She wanted to go offline for a while, so I just wanted to let her know how I felt. I told her ""I love you."" and she said ""I love you too"". She isn't single, she's dating my friend, but I have a huge crush on her, and we are really close. It happened 4 hours ago from when I posted this, and I'm extremely concerned what happened. ""I love you too"" is the last thing she said to me. She hasn't said anything since, and I feel extremely depressed because I may have been unable to stop my closest friend from committing suicide.",0
I told a guy who I thought was my friend something personal. It wasn‚Äôt too deep but something anyone with half a brain should know not to share. I told my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù not to share it. I only told him something personal because he wanted to know more about me. So I opened up. But I also told him not to tell people about my family. I thought he was cool and we were friends for a couple weeks. I was new to making friends after deciding to open out of my shell. But now that this asshole tells people lies and rumors about me it just broke me. He tried texting me saying he didn‚Äôt say anything but obviously I‚Äôm not that stupid. This seriously just broke me down. I hate people who use me for company. I just can‚Äôt trust anyone or make friends. Now the school thinks I‚Äôm a crazy weirdo. Some fvcked up lies have been said about me. I don‚Äôt even talk to anyone besides a couple people. How did this happen. Assholes. :(,0
"I've been depressed most of my life. I know I should have seeked help long ago because, even now, I have never told my doctors that I'm depressed. When I was a young boy, gaming was my passion. I miss those days; no responsibilities and no meddlesome relationships to distract me from my pasttime. Now I'm much older and the depression hasn't waned a bit. Depression and responsibilities both grew. I got engaged a while back and, as happy as my partner makes me, I still have my personal fits of depression. This may seem cynical, but one person can only do so much for another. I wish I didn't, but I have accepted that painful truth. What really hurts me the most about my state now is that I can no longer truly enjoy playing video games anymore. As I said before, gaming was my passion. Now that I don't have any motivation to play as many games anymore, it makes me feel like I'm throwing my wonderful past with gaming away. I'm really sad. I just keep pouring my thoughts out and going on tangents. Sorry for this long rant. Thank you for reading this far.",0

My family literally is talking about me behind my back and it makes me feel extremely hurt and violated. I‚Äôm just trying to vent and help other people and everybody here and on reddit, each and every single one of you is amazing and i love you all. Fuck my family right now, like honestly I can‚Äôt. i once did this to my sister and i only read one post she published in r/BPD about writing her own suicide notes and planning on committing suicide, but she was burning herself and being psychotic and about to commit suicide like I'm not in that place right now but it sure makes me feel worse that my family doesn't trust me. I am not psychotic, I have a great judgement of reality actually and my own therapist said it.",0

I‚Äôm not as smart as I thought I was. I‚Äôm not important to anybody. I have nothing to offer to the world. It‚Äôs just a hard realization I came to.

I had plans yesterday to make today a special outing. I was going to see a movie by my self and then hit the bar for the first time to grab a drink.

"Over the past several months, I've had some incredible highs and some incredible lows. I had been really struggling for a few months, but lately I seemed to be on an upswing. Something about NYE really brought me down though. The night itself seems to synonymous with ""fresh starts"" and ""new beginnings."" For me, it felt lonely. Since NYE I've been super depressed again - defined by the idea that I am not hopeful and any fresh start I have will inevitably lead to another dead end. Will a fresh start change the way I look or change how attractive I am? Will a fresh start make me more likable? More outgoing? More equipped to make friends and meet new people? The truth is, it doesn't matter how many fresh starts I am given: I will always, fundamentally, be the same person, and I will continue to let forces outside of my control define who I am as a person. I recognize how pessimistic this is. I recognize that this way of thinking doesn't do anything to help me. I just needed to rant.",0

Right now I want to practice my drawing, I'm not very good at it but I really enjoy it and I'd love to be a skilled artist one day. But right now I have plans to kill myself on February 1st. I'm going to lock myself in my bathroom and just start taking pills until something happens. I haven't completely given up or anything like that, I'm putting my last bit of energy into this last month of my life, I'm doing everything I can to get help, but this is it. If I'm not able to get help or at least some real faith that help is on the way then I'm done. So even if I enjoy drawing it seems like a huge waste to practice if I'm just going to die anyway.

I go on Discord and see people talking about how college helped them form friends, and I remember how all the friends I met in college I ended up hating. And hearing younger people having good, validating social lives stings harder than I thought it would. So why can't I be social.

Am I just a spoiled lazy kid, or is what I'm claiming real. I DO feel shitty sometimes, but I'm in a sort of hibernation the rest of the time if that makes any sense. I DO remember having real issues with anxiety, finding it incredibly hard to talk to people at times but right now it doesn't really feel like anything. I have a couple of really good friends but I don't really like hanging out with them anymore. I've just sort of accepted where I'm at right now. I've talked to my friends about depression but even though they could relate and have issues of their own, I feel like they're still going forward with life.

"Hi, I'm in my senior year in high school, and I need help with my girlfriend. While I currently do not have depression, she does. One thing that worries me the most is her pessimism. Sometimes, there will be a situation that she is not looking forward to (for example, she is getting her wisdom teeth out tomorrow), and she gets incredibly down and grumpy about the situation. I have told her that it will be ok and that I'm here for her, but she continues to rebut with ""I'm being logical and I'm correct that it will suck"". How do I help her? Obviously she is right and it will suck (I've gotten my wisdom teeth out so I'm definitely aware of the pain), but she still gets really depressed and pessimistic about everything. What do I say? I've already introduced the idea of therapy and she definitely did not like that, so as of now, I'm at a loss as to what to do. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

I still can't get the idea that I'm a fucking hopeless drug addict out of my head. That I don't fucking deserve a second chance at doing something in my life. Wish me luck, everyone.",0
"I just wanted to get this off my chest. I have a feeling these past months thinking my dad will die soon. I feel it‚Äôs going to come and I won‚Äôt be able to make him happy. I can‚Äôt make him happy. I feel he‚Äôs been depressed for so long. I don‚Äôt know how to make him happy. I have tried everyday to think about positive things and how I would make him happier, but I can‚Äôt. My mindset is not right because he makes the family (my mom and I) unhappy everyday. He is always grumpy and I don‚Äôt know how to cheer him up. He doesn‚Äôt want to do anything. I don‚Äôt feel like trying anymore. I know he‚Äôs dying soon. I am so sad because of it. I am so sad I don‚Äôt get to spend enough time with him to make him happy. I‚Äôm sad because I disappointed him for not working and wanting to study. He wanted me to work instead of study. But that logic is flawed. Because I need to finish school so I can get a better job. For him. But he‚Äôs dying. And that makes me so unmotivated to do anything. Sometimes I feel like dying first. I want to give up life. Life is too hard.",0

I sometime feel great and productive in the morning and when I‚Äôm about to leave home, I get this very down feeling forcing me to overthink about my appearance, my life, my education. Or in the other word, I feel good in the morning and feel worse in the afternoon. It happens like only 1 or 2 days a week, sometimes every 2 weeks, or sometimes none in a week. I have googled stuff about depression and bipolar (not sure what‚Äôs the difference) but I‚Äôm not certain what I‚Äôm going through. I‚Äôve been getting told to see a therapist on the internet but I don‚Äôt feel like spending my money on that especially I have financial issues. Oh btw I‚Äôm male 20yo.",0

"Ive been going through so much at this point, and I want to let it out all out so please bear with me since I'm just depressed at this point. You might relate to this. I love too much and it's hurting me because they don't love me or care for me back. It's not romantic wise. It's just one of those genuine friendship types. They distance themselves away from me because they know that's what's best for our relationship It's all my fault I ruined our friendship. I put too much care into them. I bought them a lot of things to show how much I care. But I messed up. I messed up big time. I was living in denial the whole time. I found out they only still care about me because they're a good person. Not because I'm something. I was such an idiot. I was the asshole beachside I kept expecting something in return from them. And I can't stop caring about them. I want to isolate myself from them for good, because they don't deserve someone like me at all. All I did was hurt. I easily get jealous when they give care and attention to someone else. My god, I'm just really sad and heartbroken at this point. Just a depressed teen here, crying hot tears in bed, and listening to chill hop. I am nothing but a horrible piece of shit. To make things worse, one of my closest friends in high school are in the hospital, unable to speak at all because they were shot on Christmas. My dad fell super ill as well... Life really does give you a box of chocolates, doesn't it?",1
"Perpetually asked if you're ok and always respond with "" I'm fine "". It's pathetic I know, but I always just want someone to reach out and just know that I'm not fine. Obviously, this will never happen... but I have too much pride to ever tell someone I need help. I can't tell my parents because I fear their judgment. I can't tell my friends because none are close enough and even if they were... they wouldn't care. They'd care on the surface, but the next day it's back to their lives and that's that. That doesn't make them bad friends...I'd probably be the same way. Everyone has their own problems they don't need to be hassled with mine. I don't know what I'm looking for with this post or if I'm even looking for anything. I guess it's more for me... to just tell someone... even if it's just to one of you random people that actually read this. I've never told anyone how I really feel or ever even posted something like this anonymously, but here I am. Thanks to anyone who listened. For anyone who feels somewhat similar...

"This is my first time posting here. I have been mentally going downhill for a few years now. About 3 years ago my dad got sick with cancer and went through all the treatments, radiation, surgeries, chemotherapy and eventually when all else failed, immunotherapy. He ended up in the ICU on a ventilator for a few weeks until he ultimately passed away. This whole experience broke me. He was my person. My mom and I aren't very close. I have no other close family members. I definitely felt myself slipping once he got sick and then watching him get worse and worse. He died in April and I've been functioning but I feel fucking terrible most days. I wake up feeling so shitty, like complete despair. I feel like this planet and most of the people on it suck to be frank. I never had a clear cut direction or passions to follow so I find myself thinking about my purpose a lot. I do wish I could end my life some days but I know I never will. I go to therapy. I have tried some medications but honestly I haven't found anything that works. I don't enjoy anything really so I don't have hobbies. I do have a fiance. He is a saint. He's my only real support. He's been getting me through. I just need to know of anyone who has been this bad and came back. What meds have worked for you, what have you done to get yourself out of this? I had a difficult childhood too and therapy has brought up a ton of emotional baggage that's contributing to my mental state.",0
"I just turned 20 in mid December, I don‚Äôt have a job, I don‚Äôt go to school and my girlfriend (of two years) that told me she wanted to be together forever and even shared a dog with me has been ignoring me since Thanksgiving. I caught her getting almost daily voicemails left on her phone by a guy I was clear I wasn‚Äôt okay with the flirting with. Today I got a text out of the blue saying She wants to meet in person this week to ‚Äúmove on‚Äù. Every part of me still wants to be with her and it kills me to think of a life without her; especially after going as far as planning our futures together. I thought the holidays were going to be the worst of it, but I‚Äôm slowly realizing that when everyone is getting back into their routines I‚Äôm still stuck. I want to get a job and go to school and be successful, but I feel trapped in this dark pit. I really don‚Äôt want to live anymore and the only thing keeping me from killing my self is the pain and disarray I would cause my Mom and Dad. I see a psychiatrist and take antidepressants daily; I have since I was 13. I don‚Äôt want to open myself up completely to my therapist because of my fears of being shipped to a mental health hospital. My parents in the past have seriously suggested that I stay in one.

I want to get a job that is enjoyable but I don't know what to do beside accounting and I don't really find accounting that fun or have any passion towards it. I just feel very lost right now because after searching for a job for 2-3 months after I graduated, I kinda gave up because 1 offer I got was like below 30k and internship I went to during school, I was like an errand boy in office and doing filing and trash work. I can't stand that shit everywhere I go. I'm just really lost with my life. Every day is passing and it's 6 month before you know it. Fuck, I am just wasting away. I want to go to social events and all that but I want female friends to go with and I don't know how to go about making friends since I am pretty nervous or introvert around females.

"After being tossed aside by a few people now that I considered really close to me, it has me wondering if it‚Äôs even worth meeting new people.

I don‚Äôt want to start over again telling people about myself, telling stories, explaining how I think, and all of those things you naturally do when you know someone for years. It‚Äôs not even just loneliness, it‚Äôs a feeling of dread knowing that you‚Äôre going to have to go through the same things that you did with the people who have hurt you to try and feel like you mean something all over again.

I've managed to self-medicate with video games and youtube for years, but over the past couple weeks it stopped working. Now nothing is interesting anymore. It's driving me absolutely bonkers. I'm so stir crazy. I'm SO BORED. But I don't want to to do anything. Nothing feels worth my time. Everything makes me feel guilty that I'm not doing something else. I wish I knew hot how to emphasize how bad this is. I can FEEL it inside me, like a thirst. Like I'm craving some physical thing and if it was in front of me I'd pounce and devour it like a tiger. I've always felt uncomfortable in my skin, now it's like all of me. I need to rip myself apart to tear the corruption out. I'm going mad, just mad. Like I desperately need a sedative or something before I spiral out of control. I've never thought more seriously about hospitalizing myself. If I wasn't afraid of the treatment I'd get I'd do it now. Someone please give me some advice.",0

Well, I'm starting to think I might not be a terrible scum of Earth as I used to think, because I don't wanna do that to others.

"Hi, I am no stranger to depression my self but am having a lot of current difficulties with helping my wife through hers. As I'm sure your all know what works for one person may not work for the next. Nor is it easy to know exactly what will help the best, especially when the depression hinders the sufferer from understanding their own needs, being able to express them and sometimes even not being able to accept the help even if it is exactly what they were asking for. I love my wife deeply and would love to help her in any way that I can. I think I need a bit of a different perspective on this.

"I'm just lying here wondering what the point is of living. I'm not actively suicidal, but I feel like life isn't worth it *at all.* A brief run down of my life: I'm a graduate student. I've sunk 80k into my current career path, for a total of 120k in loans. I have one semester left to complete and I should be looking forward to it but I'm dreading it instead. I've lost my passion for my field and I know I'm drowning in debt. I'll make around 45k a year when I graduate so I'll be in debt until I'm 52. I feel like I have thrown my life away. I worked really, really hard for 8 years in college and it wasn't worth it. I am 25lbs over weight, the most I've ever weighed in my life. I hate my body and myself for letting my body get this way. I have several chronic medical conditions including fibromyalgia. Life is literally pain for me. Physical pain. Nothing I do makes me feel anything but sadness. I'll be doing my absolute favorite things and be fighting back tears the whole time. All I can think about it how I'm going to have to struggle the rest of my life and it'll never get better. I won't make enough money to even take vacation or live in a nice place. I'll have to work really hard, more than healthy people, to just keep my job so I can just pay my debts and never have anything nice or any rest. And I'll be in pain the entire time until I can finally just die after a long, disgustingly hard life of struggle. The End.",1
"It's weird because in middle school, I had friends. I attended a different high school than the rest of my friends, so I talked to them less. I started having social anxiety problems around this time as well. Most of my friends started experimenting with drugs and alcohol, but I knew that wasn't for me. Still my social anxiety made me think that because I was different than them in that way, they wouldn't like me as much. I was also scared they'd pressure me into doing it with them. So I started to socially isolate myself. I'm in college now, and I really don't talk to anyone besides my family. I have two people I talk to at my job, but we don't hang out outside of work. I've learned how to keep myself entertained, but now I long for companionship. I still sometimes struggle with my social anxiety and am afraid of putting myself out there only to push people away like I did before. Also I'm kinda shy so it's hard to talk to people lol.

"Hello r/depression, Recently I have finally made sure that my tolerance to all kinds of psychiatric medicines is higher than average. That is, I have to take doses higher than average / recommendation to achieve the same level of therapeutic effects.

Have / had anyone ever been on sertraline (Zoloft) 300mg or more? Did it work better for you? Did any adverse effect happen? Have / had anyone ever been on bupropion XL (Wellbutrin XL) 450mg or more?

I have work deadlines and shit I should have done over the holidays. It was an easy work day though since I left early to get a tooth fixed that I‚Äôve neglected for more than a decade. I didn‚Äôt see the point in getting it fixed though - my dentist made me. It‚Äôs a waste of time and effort on me.

"So I heard that I should find a creative outlet to help cope with my depression... I've been suicidal for 5 years, pretty much as long as I've been depressed. Im to cowardly to actually do it but I just kind of wanna stop existing, I'm just extremely sad although I don't fully understand why. So I'm kind of by myself venting because nobody really cares, I spend most of everyday just talking to myself... Mostly self hatred negative thoughts and I guess I'm a small cause of my depression. So I'm kind of just looking for a creative outlet to let out my sadness and depression, so I have like three ideas for it. One of my major ways of coping with depression is joking about it, it has become a really good coping strategy believe it or not. I wanted to do a couple things 1 I wanted to start a YouTube channel 2 I wanted to start publishing my art 3 I wanted to start animating I really enjoy drawing, I love it and it's a form of coping for me. YouTube is kind of just something for me to not feel alone, I probably won't actually do it though I just think it'd be interesting to get like minded depressed people to kind of hang out idk but there is a lot of us that seem to relate easily. Animating has always been kind of cool, I love adventure Time and Rick and Morty, although it's kind of expensive at first I think it'd be a fun hobby for me to invest in.

I don't know why my depression is so bad today, not sure if it's the new year and the prospect of going around again with the same old bullshit of being rejected or the amount of happy couples I saw today. That always gets me... Seeing people happy, just wishing you could feel things like love, affection, closeness with someone...but knowing that's the one part of life you are permanently gated from. All I want to do is die but I can't so I guess lifetime of misery it is..",0
I have been dealing with depression for years now and have been doing everything I can to get better. Recently I have been having suicidal thoughts. And even though I have no intention of following through I feel as though my depression would. Whenever I used to get this way I‚Äôd think of all the things I love in this world and I‚Äôd change my mind pretty quick. But now it seems every time I try to do that those thoughts get choked out by my depression. Every positive thought I have gets drowned out and stomped on by the suicidal thoughts and general self loathing. All motivation is gone for me and this point and I do things simply so I am not a burden to people anymore. I‚Äôm scared that in a slump of sel hatred and meaninglessness I‚Äôll do something stupid.. I‚Äôm not myself when I‚Äôm depressed and I don‚Äôt know how to fix it.,0

"Hi guys, Looking for any help I can get! I've been on Pristiq 100mg for 10 years. (Stupidly got forced into it at 18 when my brain was still maturing). Spent the last two years on 50mg, and the last 6 months cutting it in half, then quarters, then 8ths. (I know you're not meant to cut them, but all docs seemed to have no idea what to do.) I really haven't felt sad or hopeless since I was about 20ish, so have just been taking them as I could never get help or instructions for tapering off from docs. These last 2 weeks, I've stopped taking the 8th of a tablet and oh my God. I don't know who I am. The side effects are terrible. I am jumbling my words, mental blanking so hard that some days I can't remember how to get home, or find my car in the car park. Extremely angry and irritable, crying over everything, literally a cute freaking dog on TV. I forget basic words, today I referred to the pantry as the bathroom, just weird shit. My short term memory.. Is non existant. I just had to ask my partner to repeat what I just said to him cause I couldn't remember. I start making up words and somehow convince myself they're a word!? (Refrigenative???)wtf. Yet I'm a lit nerd. I'm an executive too.. In the advertising industry. Words and well written sentences and quick wit are what my career revolves around. I am fucked. Would love to know if anyone else has been in this situation.. I don't know what to do. :( This whole experience just makes me want to jump in front of a truck. All because I wanted to get off these medal before I have kids..",0
"She said it's because our daily conversations in the past was something she deliberately attempted to adjust to because it's not her cup of tea. I don't get her. I don't get her at all. I asked her why she hadn't informed me, because I wouldn't have found out if I hadn't brought it up. She said it was an out of mind, out of sight sort of thing and she doesn't really need to tell me every single thing, that she thought I figured it out, but eventually she apologized and said that it was disrespectful of her to suddenly revert to her usual ways when she knows I'm used to the contrary. I... don't know what this all means. Am I boring? Does she not want me? Am I supposed to be mad at her? Is she worth keeping? What do you people make of this?",0
"Hi Im not sure if it goes here but, I dont really remember last time I was genuinely happy. Sometime I am happy about something for a few minutes to a few hours but then I realize that it didn't change anything in my life and feel like that thing was useless. So I have that feeling that nothing ever change in my life and everything end up being a waste of time that was supposed to be fun or a ""life changing event"". Anyway I am just tired of feeling like im wasting my life and I dont understand what makes other people actually happy. Thanks for taking the time to read this.",0
"I'm afraid it will go out of hand one day or another. I stop myself from going to places and talking to people, just to feel miserable afterward, then I bask in my misery.

"to take the ""I want to die every second of the day"" edge off - but don't be fooled, the depression hasnt gone anywhere. numb, but depressed. I tried to cry today, I can't even remember the last time I did. I was upset, pissed, you name it - I just couldn't fucking cry. *that's all the pill - turns me into a fucking zombie.* anyways, almost outta frustration I just started wailing on my head. it worked, I cried and it felt great to finally let that shit out despite my head throbbing! love sucks. money sucks. love especially sucks. I'll dust my self off tomorrow and try again, but depression's a worthy adversary. the war's exhausting but it's worth it.. or at least it's supposed to be ?",0
How do you explain depression to someone who just doesn‚Äôt get it or understand it at all?,0
I don‚Äôt really know how to describe myself rn. I almost don‚Äôt wanna say I‚Äôm depressed because I know that clinically I am but over the last couple months the despair I was feeling has kinda subsided a lot but now I‚Äôm falling back into a loneliness. I know there‚Äôs no cause but the surges of emotions I‚Äôm feeling are getting stronger and It‚Äôs getting harder to bear. I just wish I wasn‚Äôt like this but it‚Äôs just the cards I was dealt I guess I‚Äôm ok.,0
"I have completely isolated myself since I was 13. Im 18 now. Just stopped talking to the few friends i had. My whole life just fell before my eyes. I thought I was gonna have a good happy life, go to college, have a girlfriend by now and be having kids within a few years. I literally have only one friend. I gave up a long time ago. I forgot what happiness is, and the ability to have a social life. I have a social job but thats it - im so unhappy and hopeless. I feel like i have no options. I really want to have the life I always thought i would. More importantly, I want the motivation to have a normal life. But I dont know how to get it back. Please help me.",0
"So tired of the real world. What a depressing, soul sucking place we live in. I want a world where i make the right choice more often, where i have the willpower to do things i don't want to do. I want the fantastic magic and talking creatures and the amazing plots to involve me. I love to read and watch fantasy, but its more and more painful the more i think about how much i want it, knowing its not going to happen. I'm tired of always making the wrong choice and never having the willpower to make myself do the things i need to.",0
"Idk whether it's related to this sub's theme or not but I feel so exhausted because of this disguisting habit. I'm lying everyone even about my favorite colour, not to mention about my current mental condition. Why am I doing this?",0
"I been feeling really down and lonely as many of my so called ‚Äòfriends‚Äô have stopped talking to me and I feel like I have no friends or people to hang out with ? I understand people move on and from now on I imagine that they are the ones missing out on a awesome guy as their friend üòÇ!! Though I don‚Äôt know how to become more social with people and where I should start, there is also the fear that this may keep happening and I make bonds and they never last. One thing I always stand by though Is staying true to yours-self and being my weird self but that‚Äôs got me nowhere. I just don‚Äôt want it to start affecting me and get to he point where I am doubting my own personality üòè!! Ps: I am members of various groups and in uni just as A site note ‚ò∫Ô∏è",0

"So the thing here is I stopped caring about my reputation. I care nothing about keeping a good reputation and some of my friends warned me about keeping a 'good' reputation. I seem to be the easy going and not caring kind of person, is it related to me being a girl? Is that why I have to respect everything and say that I'm good with everything other people say? Do I have to 'fake' being a polite girl? I know it's because I have different cultures but I don't feel like it's myself or me.Do I really have to change myself? Do I have to stop doing this kind of attitude? What did I do wrong here? I didn't even realised when I stopped caring about anyone or anything, it just happened. Why do I feel like crying eventhough this is just me and my stubborn ego? Am I way too rough to socialize with anyone at all? I know not many people will reply to this but it would be nice if I at least know if someone feels the same way as I do.",0
Im 34 turning 35 in a couple of weeks and I'm a big time loser who needs help. I have a part time job that I don't like and I don't work hard at. I am in school for social work but I don't get good grades and I used all of my like money to pay for it. I don't have any savings and I can barely pay my bills every month. I give the appearence that I have money and I'm working hard but I really don't feel like I am because I funny want to. I have a girlfriend that I love but I fear she is going to leave me if she finds out the truth. I dont know what to do with my life or I dont know how to set goals for myself. I want to get married and have kids but I'm not prepared for it. Im used to heartbreak and disappointment and if it happens again in my relationship I feel like im going to kill myself. Ive been a christian most of my life and I trust in God to help me but I still feel like crap because im in the same boat I'm in 15 years ago. I have too much shame and regret to feel good about what God has planned for me,1
This isn't a suicide thing. My head just hurts. Crying so much I have a headache. My fucking ear won't stop ringing. Great. I have tinnitus at 18 despite having been to 2 concerts in my life. God saw me and laughed as He kicked my brain-dead mind into this world.,0
"I've fucked up a lot. I've ruined every part of my life possible. I've dug this hole, and hit rock bottom, and there is literally no way to fix it. I know people will say it's all fixable, but trust me, it's not. There's too many things wrong. So it's like I -need- to do it because my life will not get better, and even if I want to hang on, there's no point.",0
"It's been a crappy winter so far. Found out I'm going to be out of a job at the end of the month and I don't know what else I'm going do do with myself. My car is continuing to fall apart. I had been saving some money in hopes of buying a new one, but I'm not quite going to be there when the revenue stops. On top of that, I've developed a skin condition right near my eyes, and having it happen over the holidays has made scheduling a specialist very difficult. It's gotten worse since then and I don't think it's going to heal easily. Apart from all of that, I declined to go to a relatively important holiday party because I feel like crap. I already have a terrible social life, but I'm not making things any better for myself. Worst of all, I fell like I seriously disrespected the people I avoided and missed a once in a lifetime chance to know them better. I suck suck suck. I knew I was going to feel bad about staying home, but felling how I do lately, I just can't handle myself. Either way, I feel hurt pretty badly, but sitting home licking my wounds is a shame on me and no one else.",0
"Does anyone have advice for finding and sticking to hobbies. I've tried to pick up things in the past but never really gotten a feeling of enjoyment/satisfaction. At some point I thought that I could motivate myself by using it as a prompt to improve social interactions... but I could never get that flywheel spinning either. tl,dr; what hobbies have you taken up that have stuck? What, if any, separates a hobby that sticks from one that doesn't? How do you quarantine the hobby from the depressive feeling that seep in?",0
"I've become so forgetful in the midst of my depression in the past... oh, 2 or 3 years that I genuinely don't have a lot of strong memories from 2017. Seriously, it's not just a case of me still thinking that it's 2017, it's more of that I almost feel like I... slept through 2017 or something. I feel the same with the latter half of 2016. I remember 2017, I suppose, but I don't really feel like I LIVED through 2017. The entire year feels like a blur, and no other year from my memory feels like that.",0

"Lately, most often at night, I'll get extremely anxious and begin feeling like I'm not me. Like I was someone else who was placed into this body. I also get the physical feeling that the world stops existing, and that I am isolated to my area. I feel like I'm going insane. This has started recently (last 2-3 months), I'm 17, and have not begun taking, or have stopped taking any medications. Is this an anxiety attack? I'm either numb, or this, and I'm scared this is forever.",1
"I feel like all my emotions are fake, and everything I say is a lie because of it. I feel like my bad days are just fake and in my mind, and anything I like is garbage that I'm not really interested in, I end up feeling like I don't really love friends and family. I just end up hating myself because of these feelings and feeling even more detached from the world. Why do I have to sabotage my own mind and feelings?",1
everything seems hopeless and quaint I don't know why I've been dropped in this life and expected to make something happen for myself I just don't have the options or resources to make things work for myself at this point it makes no sense to try and hope effort make a difference for me,0
How about this. I need to work so I earn income. Because I need to feel like a functioning part of society. I need to eat and pay for accommodation. I have to put fuel in the car that gets me around and then gradually save up for retirement while hopefully enjoying the time I have off in between. GOOD ENOUGH FOR YA?,0
"I seriously have so much anxiety in me going on that I can‚Äôt stand it any more, only thing I do is lay in bed and do nothing at all. I am diagnosed with a generalized anxiety disorder and take medicine but it does not help. I had a lot of therapy but nothing helped. All my thoughts are going round the same topic: what can I do today to help myself? Meditation? Active things? Take a bath? Read a book? What should I do?!?! And this repeats till I go to bed again and my results are that I did nothing. Lol. How can I break this crazy cycle?",0
If I don‚Äôt get into one of them I‚Äôll most likely kill myself sometime in my life,0
"I have been trying to have a baby for the last 4 years and after several miscarriages, and late periods here I am empty handed. There is this huge void in my heart and It has been horrible this past holiday season. I usually can shut out the baby stuff but everyone on social media is having a baby. My heart yearns more everyday and it isn't any closer to happening. Every single month I'm so disappointed in myself and my body. Aunt flo comes without fail...oh would you look at that..",0
"I feel like I've lost all that is good in this world. I use to have so many dreams and ideas of things I wanted to do.

I‚Äôm on the verge of ending it.. just had a 4 hr phone call of how I‚Äôm a fuck up. There‚Äôs no point to this.,0

"Thanks to my academic background and my application I've received multiple unconditional offers to study Psychology and Counselling. However, this past year I've suffered terribly with depression and my life feels like its falling apart. I've lost all interest and motivation for anything. My question is about whether it would be wise to go to University despite suffering with this condition and not knowing when or if it will get better. Should I take some time off to focus on myself? Do I even need it? Am I just a pussy? I don't even know any more.",0
"Hi! Was just with my therapist and she suggested that when depression says ‚Äòisolate yourself from your friends and family‚Äô, do the exact opposite. Seek them out. When anxiety says ‚Äòavoid all your problems‚Äô, face them head on. Depression has a way of convincing you that only the worst things are true. Tell your inner saboteurs to kindly fuck off! You deserve much better. This is much easier said than done, but if you‚Äôre like me and you enjoy being a contrary little bitch, be a contrary little bitch to depression!",0

So I took a week off because I couldnt handle work anymore and started to isolate myself again. Today I got called over and got fired for 2 reasons. 1. I dont enjoy work 2. I intentionaly ignored the manager's texts? (Took a break from social media and phone). Told me that im deadweight to the store. What now,0
"My brother came to visit me from peru, this is the first time i saw him since i was 12 (17 now). I have always lived with him and since i didn‚Äôt have a father or a supportive mother he always took the role model of a dad.

I‚Äôve been suicidal for a while now, I live with PTSD, Chronic depression and anxiety, life is really hard for me and im ready to give up.

"Everything is falling or has fallen apart. My dad killed himself several years ago because my mom left him for some douchebag with money. My dog followed three months later. I got an incurable STD from someone I trusted but shouldn't have. Ive lost my license, and my car. Im trapped in a dead end janitorial job that Ive been maxed out in for the last 3 years. My spare income goes towards weed, so I can keep myself blithe and functional. All I can do is go to work in a few hours and pretend everything is cool. Nothing will ever change. I'll always be poor. I'll always be lonely, I'll always be depressed. The woman I've been talking to is married, and on top of it, I think is close to dumping me for another side guy. I could be imagining that. Things have been different for several weeks. Then since we've gotten closer to the New Year, she distanced herself more and more. I think she's trying to get me to break up with her so she can move on guilt free. I don't know. We barely communicate. It seems like she has better things to do. My intentions are to continue suffering through life, chain smoking, pounding sugar, and eating junk, until I get diabetes, heart disease, or cancer, and let it go untreated to kill me. I have tremendous respect for people who have the balls to kill themselves. Im not strong enough to be one of them. I wonder if I'm even depressed or just too fucking lazy to do anything for myself..? I just don't want to live.",0
"I know the feeling of complete and utter despair that many of you face daily. I know that in many ways it is not cope-able. You feel like you‚Äôre dying inside or you very much have a desire to not live anymore. I know that pain and how real it is. However, just know that with the right doctor and the right combination of medications, it will subside almost completely. If you‚Äôre constantly feeling this pain, then something is clearly wrong with your treatment. Just know that it does get better. It does get easier. Brain chemistry can be a real asshole at times, but it is very treatable and you don‚Äôt have to live in a constant state of suffering. Hang on to that hope. =)",0
"So today in particular was a very bad day, I found out that my sister's husband beated my other sister who has been suffering from severe depression and he kept on calling her degrading terms (slut, bitch ) while my other sister is watching through the car, he also broke her phone, there were some 2 pieces of shit watching that didn't do anything, he also broke her expensive phone with all the data, I'm very angry and I think I might commit a murder I can't restrain myself. I also beated my father today because he said my sister deserves it Sorry I just don't have anyone to talk to about it",0
"I think I used to look good when I was about 10-13. Then I started getting acne and my face started growing and getting fucked. My nose is huge, my eyes are asymmetrical, my jaw is asymmetrical, my face is fat as fuck even though Im thin as a stick, My teeth are yellow and asymmetrical, One ear sticks out really much while the other one is flat. Literally everything is wrong with me. I never go out anymore and every time i see myself in the mirror I get one step closer to killing myself. And when I see myself in the camera I look like a fucking freak, like I belong in a zoo. Everyone around me is so fucking perfect. I dont have any friends and nobody likes me, Its just a matter of time before I do it.",1
"For the last few years I've ben hopping in and out of depression, but recently I have stopped caring about myself, I just want to make the people around me happy so that they don't end up the same way as me. But I can't. Why? I always try to be as supportive and open as I can, never turn down invitations and try to hide what's inside me. I feel like everyone would rather not have me with him, that everyone sees me as a ""third weel"", an extra weight they have to carry on their shoulders, and that my ""friends"" are acting friendly just for compassion.

"I think back to when I was a kid and everything was so colourful and vibrant and experiences were new and fresh. Everything felt so real and so exciting and the possibilities were endless with regards to our futures and our dreams. Nowadays I don't get a buzz, I don't get a sense of excitement from anything really, I don't get it. I don't feel depressed, I don't feel down but I do feel like I'm sort of floating through life without a purpose and it's not a nice feeling to have. I'm training to be a teacher and I love working with the kids because it gives me that sense of excitement and fun again and I can see them learning and embracing every experience with both hands but for me I don't have that and it worries me. I don't want to bumble about waiting for something to excite me, I want it now, but I don't know what IT is. I have interest and hobbies but nothing that makes me want to get up early in the morning and go for it. I don't really know what I'm saying. I guess I need to change my habits and diet maybe to feel more energised and proactive but it's so easy to just curl up and forget the world whenever you get the chance.",0
"Hei. I'm trying to start loving myself and stop harming my body. While I'm seeing a professional I would like to find someone who had similar experience maybe? How to start loving yourself? I have this huge problem where I hurt myself when someone hurts me emotionally to the point where I can't take it anymore. I just find physical pain more bearable. I used to cut and scratch myself. Lately I started to burn myself with this acid pen (used to heal warts) - i just drip that acid on my skin and watch it burn my skin. then I concentrate on physical not emotional pain. I know I can't keep on going like this. besides working out, finding a hobby, reading books.. what else can I do to take my mind off of that? is there something I could do while I'm at work? I don't really have anyone to talk with about this. Thank you, have a great day.",0
"The only thing that's really kept me alive is the realization that I am alive in order to make everyone around me better than what I am myself and to live for them instead of myself. My life continued for others, never myself. Yesterday my father explained to me how much I've affected people - in this moment I was faced with the truth I put off for more than 11 years. Being alive hurts people - financially, emotionally and physically. The only reason I am alive has been conflicted - this is when I realized I was fucked. The suicide note I made a few weeks ago will be edited, I apologize. Even this post is doing what I hate to do, which now makes me a hypocrite.",0
Like i have a ok life im homeless right now its not the first time i have some fake friends not first i have little family my mom died a couple weeks ago (im 14) all this stuff is bad but im kinda use to this i losted all energy to live yet i cant kill myself because i know i would hurt maybe 2 or 3 people idk anymore haha,0
"I have been depressed for 6 years now. I went to see a therapist and I told my parents and friends about it, around 5 years ago. A year after that, I just accepted my depression and I acted like everything was going great. My parents and everyone else were relieved and I swore that I would never tell anyone about my burden anymore. But it feels good to admit it here. I honestly believed that I deserved all those horrible feelings and lack of happiness, but I have a better self-esteem now and I want to feel better. I'm no longer thinking that I deserve this, no one does actually. I'm considering getting help again but I wonder if a therapist can trust me after faking getting better to another therapist?

I know that I Was alienated by other people since middleschool and I never really learned to interact with others. At that time I didn't really think my Situation is bad... Maybe that was because I didn't have much experience and I knew atleast how to physically defend my self. Or is it, that I don't evaluate it right and these experiences were a factor that played a roll..... Maybe I'm forgeting something mmhhh.. It also be because of my view of the World..

"Hello, in need of some advise. I have a 2 year old greyhound who I have had for 1 year and I am thinking of giving him up. The reason for this is because of my lack of motivation due to my anxiety and depression. I never walk him because I can‚Äôt seem to make myself go out the house, I stay at home all day and it seems the only time I ever clean my house is when I have something to look forward which is another story but anyway due to not walking my dog he wees in my house and even poos sometimes, he is wrecking my house! He chews my carpets, eats anything in sight and I just can‚Äôt cope with him. I really do love him but he is ruining my life, I can‚Äôt even take him anyway because he destroys other people‚Äôs houses too. I think because he is a working dog he needs lots of walks to release his energy and because I don‚Äôt I think he is using that energy on ruining my house.

"Long story short, I have long suspected that I have at least a mild form of depression. I function okay on the day-to-day and present ""normal"" and am not suicidal, but I go through waves where I become extremely upset (a.k.a. ball my eyes out about the state of my life every few months) and deep down I am pretty chronically unhappy with my life, although I try to avoid thinking about this very often because it just makes me sad. I come from a family of high achievers that doesn't believe in this kind of stuff (if i were to say I am depressed, they will just say you are lazy, in a funk, etc.) and I am broke/do not have health insurance (so therapy/meds out of the question). Is there an online test or something I can take to see if I have depression? Obviously I know it cannot take the place of a medical professional, but that isn't an option for me right now.

Tuesday was the first day back to work after the Christmas holidays and I couldn‚Äôt face going in so I told them I was working from home which was fine. Then this morning came around and I laid in bed for a good 2 hours before convincing myself to take a sick day and be alone with my thoughts (working from home wasn‚Äôt an option today) I‚Äôve been home all day just dotting between Reddit, naps and the Xbox recharging my batteries but everyone close to me has tried to contact me to see that I‚Äôm ok and ask if I want to be visited. I‚Äôve had 5 concerned messages so far including coworkers, my manager and my mother all asking what they can do to help and I just want to say ‚Äòleave me alone‚Äô but can‚Äôt be rude or ungrateful even though it‚Äôs making me feel worse.",0

"Hi there, so on the 21st of December my doctor prescribed me 20mg Citalopram (Celexa) for my anxiety, depression, CPTSD and OCD symptoms. Unfortunately at the exact same time I became quite ill with the most troubling symptom being difficulty and pain urinating so the doctor told me to quit the drug to rule it out. I'm still struggling a little bit with this now after a week of being off of the drug, but it turns out it's actually just pretty bad constipation. That's getting better now so I'm wanting to give the medication another go, but I'm really worried about the sexual part of the side effects. The few days I was on Citalopram, I lost all interest in sex. My penis felt pretty much numb and masturbating just to relieve myself was a stressful chore thanks to the delayed ejaculation. I've heard quite a lot about how these are side effects that don't really pass with time and may even continue after treatment with the drug stops, that's terrifying to me. What's the use in getting me out of this depression and anxiety and possibly being able to get myself another girlfriend if I'm not even going to be able to perform properly anyway? Or even enjoy it? This might be a deal breaker for me so I was wondering if anybody has had any positive experiences with this? Did it pass over time or go back to normal as soon as you quit the drug? Thanks TLDR: Scared of the sexual side effects of Celexa, any positive experiences to ease my worry?",0

"So, I‚Äôve come to conclusion that the worst part about depression is how easy it is to convince yourself things are fucking awful but it‚Äôs so so hard to tell yourself things are good. Everytime something good happens I can see a way to ruin it. Because I always ruin everything. My new girlfriend? Shes going to leave me because I am not good enough and never will be good enough to love anyone as beautiful as her the way she deserves. Maybe it‚Äôs kinder to let her go so she can find someone who really loves her and can properly show it. Not me. Not someone who sleeps all day forgets to text forgets to hang out can‚Äôt even muster up the fuckin spine to tell her how I feel. No wonder she doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me. No wonder she hates to spend time with me. I am a stain. I am nothing. To no one. Why bother? This is just some weird rambling. I don‚Äôt know. I just want to isolate myself so I can stop hurting other people. And once I‚Äôve succeeded at being completely alone then I won‚Äôt feel so guilty about putting up a front and I cut and purge and end it all I want. Fuck me.",1

"I feel as if depression has turned me into some sort of subhuman creature. Every time I talk to one of my friends, they tell me about their days stuffed full of classes and going out and traveling and somehow still fitting in basic care of themselves and their homes. They talk about living their best lives, and how they are in their prime. I feel like I am talking to a completely different species.

I can't fathom having the energy to work, go to school, take care of myself, dedicate time to friends, hygiene, cooking, cleaning, planning, and more all in one day, every day. But everyone I know around me my age seems to be managing such a busy, full life. I feel like a devolved form of them, only having the mental and physical capacity to handle a small fraction of what others continually accomplish daily. Just wondering if anyone else feels no longer human as well.",0
"Today has been a really bad day. I spent all day on the phone. You see, I‚Äôve been in an active foreclosure on my house for a while. Part of my mental illness is not dealing with things when they are really serious like that cause I‚Äôm scared. So at the last second I sent all the paperwork in. They never got to it and they sold my home on dec23. I‚Äôve been trying to see if there‚Äôs anything I can do but since the sale date already happened I‚Äôm pretty much done. I haven‚Äôt received a letter telling us when to move out yet but I know it‚Äôs coming. So needless to say I‚Äôve been very depressed and just for lack of a better term fragile. I‚Äôm lost. Sad. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve failed my family. Now this morning I was in a very depressed mood and my SO just blew me off and said to get over it. Like it‚Äôs something I can just get over by snapping my fingers. I can‚Äôt take it anymore. I‚Äôm gonna make some pirogies and I think after that I may finally hang myself cause I‚Äôm finallyso overwhelmed with depression and pain I don‚Äôt think it will go away. I‚Äôve never felt this bad in my whole life. I‚Äôve lost everything and I have no support system what so ever. I just don‚Äôt want to keep this fight up anymore.",0
"Nothing, everything I tried dedicating myself into always made me realize how pathetic and useless I am. Whenever I try helping someone in something things go worse or I am completely useless. I always spend most of my time in my computer doing nothing but being useless all day playing games or browsing reddit to then feel like a piece of shit at night. Whenever there's the opportunity to socialize or go out of my town I reject it because I feel a bit anxious at first or feel really lazy. All the goals I set for myself always end broken because of a lack of motivation or straight up laziness. That's just me, nothing but a waste of space and a burden to everyone around me, that is also the embodiment of laziness",1
"For my most of my life I wanted to be a musician. My best friend and I were in a band together and we were building something. However, as I entered my mid-20s and entered a serious relationship, I felt competing priorities and wanted to potentially pursue career paths that had more stability and less time away for things like touring. Since then, I've been locked in paralysis for over a year about I should be doing with my life. I feel a lot of regret about leaving the music path, yet don't feel confident enough to rejoin it either. Similarly, I feel hopeless attempting to commit myself to another path that will make me fulfilled. The more I think about things and analyze them, the more my brain takes me down a dangerous path of regret, anxiety, and despair. Any words of encouragement of solidarity would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",0
"I went to therapy for a few sessions and the book ""Feeling Good: the New Mood Therapy"" was required reading. The book highlights unhealthy thinking patterns and trains you in how to spot them. I've found that All or Nothing thinking is a root to much of my hopelessness and causes self fulfilling prophecies. For example, I assume that I'm going to suck at a job and never get promoted, so I don't try hard because I view the effort as futile. The prediction therefore fulfills itself. I recommend this powerful, encouraging book, it's available in B&amp;N for about $12.00. It's the foundation of all modern Cognitive Behavioral Therapy that modern psychologists use. Bottom line, if you can't afford therapy, try it out.",0

"I'm a 38(m), and I've been taking Cymbalta for a little over a year. About 2 months ago, I started feeling very depressed again for no reason, and having bouts of extreme anger. I informed my doc, and she doubled my dose to 60mg. Since then, my depression and anger have gotten much much worse. My life is amazing right now. I have a wife who loves me and supports me through all of my depression and anxiety issues. She is learning how to talk me down off the cliff sometimes, but it is a crapshoot as to whether she is able to or not. I have two wonderful little girls, who bring me so much joy. Yesterday, I had a terrible day all day. I can't get motivated to do what I need to do at work, and when I do, I have terrible anxiety that I'm going to fuck something up and get fired. I spent most of the day yesterday shaking at my desk, because I couldn't even make myself move half the time. I got home, and had a fight with my wife, because I was taking everything she said the wrong way, to the point that I eventually just broke down crying for NO REASON. I cried for probably 45 minutes over nothing. These episodes are happening more and more frequently. The last time I remember feeling this way was when I got the bright idea to stop taking my Cymbalta completely, and that was an unmitigated DISASTER. I had a complete breakdown, and nearly left my entire family. I'm terrified that if Cymbalta has indeed stopped working for me that I'm going to have to stop taking it, and will end up having another breakdown. I absolutely hate my brain...",1
"I feel like there's a great war in my head between what I know is the 'best' way to live, and what is the 'easiest'. Every day, I just sit inside, playing computer games. I'm struggling to do anything else at all. I could study for the upcoming exam that I have, but it's uncomfortable when I don't understand something - it gives me a headache. Every single day, I tell myself that the next day is a 'new start' and a 'new opportunity' to better myself, but I NEVER DO. Never. I feel like I need someone to threaten my life or... something that shakes me out of this comfort zone. I'm well fed, clothed, I've got shelter, electricity, 'enough' money to be comfortable. Yet I'm extremely depressed. I know that I am disappointing myself and I know that I am capable of so much more. But every day, all I do is play video games. I'm stuck.",0

"These boards are riddled with self contempt and self loathing, which is naturally what you might expect on depression boards. Im not condemning anyone for expressing the pain they are dealing with, but why are there never posts or replies with constructive, helpful advice on how to move forward and make progress towards combatting this illness. The few that are posted are overlooked and ignored in favor of discussing symptoms. Someone posts on here that they often feel like killing themselves and they get a myriad of posts from people who just tell them they also feel that way. The poster feels support knowing there are other people out there just like them, but what use or aid is there in this overall? It is probably more harmful than helpful. I've been a long time lurker on these forums, also suffering myself, and I see that many people feel support and solidarity with those suffering here. Yet I can't help but feel that we are all dragging each other down. You don't cure a disease by just communing with others who have the disease and complaining about your symptoms. You make small incremental changes towards wellness to get better, and I never see any suggestions on this subreddit for people to do that.",0

"I was diagnosed with depression about 5 years ago and got prescribed prozac by my doctor at the time. About a month after taking it, I felt really self-loathing and just worse in general, instead of better. It got to the point where I nearly made an attempt on my life and got taken to the emergency room where they confiscated the medication off me. Some time went by and I decided to go back again, this time they referred me for therapy, but the waiting list went on for a year and I still heard nothing (I'm in UK where NHS have free services, I couldn't afford private counselling). The last time I went was about 2 months ago where they offered me medication again. I decided to tell them I wasn't very keen on the idea of taking anti-depressants due to what happened before, and I also mentioned that I waited a year for therapy but it never fell through, and they said something among the lines of ""we're not sure what to do then"". This feels like a really hopeless situation for me currently, but I wanted to write this to see if anybody has had something similar happened to them before, and how to dealt with it?",1

"Over the past few years of depression, my bedroom has begun to look like an episode of the Hoarders TV show... Thankfully without the bugs. Most of the mess was me just not doing laundry. My cleanliness standards were such that I didn't do laundry more than once a month, but still refused to wear dirty socks and underwear. So, being the high functioning depressive that I am, I would frequently buy new socks and underwear as I ran out and febreez my jeans and shirts between washes. The underwear took care of itself as I also gained a shit ton of weight and threw stuff out as it no longer fits, but... This week I'm doing laundry. I'm trying to clean my room (ugh). I've done 5-6 loads and I'm still not done. I have so many socks I can fill an entire basket with *just* socks. Has anyone else found themselves in this situation? How do you cope? TL;DR: I kept buying socks while super depressed. Started doing laundry and now have a fuckton of them. Wat do.",0

Which in return has caused me to lose a lot of relationships and trust for people. Heck, I‚Äôve even lost my relationship with my own mother because of this. Anyways, I‚Äôm scheduled to move into a place in the middle of January, but until then I‚Äôm out in this cold weather. I‚Äôm from a smaller town about an hour or so from DC in Virginia. Which in return has limited shelter space and resources. The shelter is double full basically every night. Social workers point me every direction. Anyone have an ideas on what I should do? I start working next week thankful, but I‚Äôm losing more steam everyday out here. Ideas? Comments? Any helpful tips to keep my head up? I‚Äôll try to respond as quickly as I can. Thank you so much for your time, Justin",0
"I told a couple friends I was considering suicide,they looked worried. Some people gotta care,right? I have not killed myself yet because I was thinking how it would affect them. They care,even if they don't talk to me a lot and I'm an idiot. If it wasn't for them I woul probably be hanging in the closet",0
"One of the remarks I had come back to was ""Oh hey *forgottensteamuser* is going to shoot up the school."" Didn't respond, but just walked away. Yeah, I know just a joke. Am I taking things too seriously?",0
My psychiatrist wants me to undergo psychological testing to make sure there are no underlying issues we are missing. This is conducted by a psychologist. This testing takes TWO 8hr days. How can it take 16hrs? Anyone been through this? What's it all about?,0
"I sometimes like to make noise with electronics to help deal with everything. I came across something that I made maybe a month or so before I was diagnosed by my trusted long-term PCP, which was in 2006. I didn't understand the emotions that I was releasing at the time, and I find it cathartically spooky to listen to [this](https://instaud.io/private/cc1e7f0733862be9071edaf8263eb10dee25be2b) 12 years later armed with the knowledge and experience with depression that I carry with me now. In your experience, what are some things that people with undiagnosed depression do outside of the common signals (like sleeping all day) that might indicate that they may have a future with depression?",0
"The wife isn't negative impact... she's not hateful or part of the problem or anything like that, she's just an unhelpful no-impact. She's supportive insofar as it isn't inconvenient to what she wants. She'll tearfully say she cares, then goes off to watch tv and does nothing to help in any way. ""Well what do you want me to do?"" I don't fucking know, man. Pay attention, figure something out. Anything other than nothing would be great. I already have a counselor, and a 1st appointment with a psych (after an adventure with my insurance fyi if ***any*** entity is actually hateful, it's any health industry entity, end rant). What I need is directly related only to my S.O. I've been asking her to get involved for years. What I get is ""I don't know what to do"" and then more tv watching.",0
"Joe Rogan Experience podcast with Chris Kresser. http://podcasts.joerogan.net/podcasts/chris-kresser-2 Doctors have been telling patients they are sick, while ignoring the obvious bad health effects of eating too much gluten or sugar. Your gut microbiome and brain chemistry and diet are intricately related, and the modern diet of toaster waffles, fried chicken, and bread/cake may be a major cause of many health issues. And a healthy diet has no bad side effects, unlike some medicines. This podcast episode opened my eyes to many insights and I hope everyone here can benefit from listening :) much love",0
So I don‚Äôt want to be here anymore but I‚Äôm also too much of a sissy to do anything about it. I‚Äôm just stuck in this shitty fucking limbo. Please help me. I need to either get brave enough to end my life or get brave enough to sort it out.,0
I'll keep it simple. Can there be happiness in despair? Because I think I felt it and I want to kill off any hope that's left for me.,0
How do I make it end? It hurts.,0
Everyone on here he keeps telling me to get help. I think I have borderline personality disorder but I heard doctors don't like people with bpd. Im scared they will just call me crazy or put me on pills that make me sleep or make my hair fall out. I'm too scared to go to therapy. I don't like talking to people about my problems.,0
"i feel like I'm purposeless idk i feel like everything I've worked for all throughout high school; all my hours devoted to clubs, taking hard af classes, etc. are just nothing and they're just going to look at my standardized tests scores and toss my application aside i explained in an additional information part about why i was able to take these tests only once and that i was in a very emotionally and physically abusive relationship but like everyone else in my life, its not going to matter that much and they're just going to be words coming out of a dumb teenage girl's mouth idk what to do anymore I'm so worthless and i feel like nothing i ever do is good enough. there's no way out and i really just want to end my life right now. i can never achieve anything i want.",1
"Friendless, depressed, the only thing i had going for myself was that i started sleeping well. Then i found out two days ago i have tinnitus. Tinnitus is a constant buzzing sound in your head that only you can hear. There are no known cures for it, and it lasts forever. I cant be at peace in my own head now. Sleeping is impossible, because the less sound there is, the louder i hear the buzzing. Living is a chore right now. All the emotions i can feel are profound sadness, anger, or complete apathy.",0
"I didn't sleep long enough last night, just a measly 7 hours and I woke up, exhausted but as I sat trying to get my day started I just got this urge to clean. My room has been an utter disaster area for a long time. No clean clothes, all of them on the floor. I just clean my work clothes, towels and washcloths. My casual clothes were all dirty. If I tried washing them they'd end up at the corner of my bed, not folded just there. I can see my floor. My clothes bins are full, the washer and dryer are full. My bed is made, I never make my bed. I'm throwing things I don't need away. I'm organizing. I'm in a really good mood and cleaning makes me feel so much better. I might read a book instead of play games later too...",0
"my best friend of 7 years just left to study abroad for 2 years, and my girlfriend just left for overseas as well for a month. i know im supposed to be happy for them, but having no one here justs makes me feel lonely and even more empty than before. i just don't know how to cope with loneliness. Any advice would be appreciated",0
"This is what I get for being optimistic. I had a good run, 6 months without feeling suicidal and now... I don't know what happend everything was going so well. I don't want to die, I really don't because I'm only 16. I feel sick and dumb and have no one to talk to. It's all just a dream, i keep telling myself. But I know it's not true",1
"Because maybe I'm called ""weak"", ""a pussy"", or an ""attention seeker"" when I do. One of the WORST things about having depression is dealing with ignorant assholes and the stigma. The stigma itself is why we refuse to tell anyone. I just want to know when people will wake up and realize that this thing isn't some kind of joke and that it is KILLING people.",1
"I bought a Groupon to have my house cleaned. They just left. They couldn‚Äôt do everything, I still have areas of my carpet to steam vac (I have cats, vomit, poop and hair factories), but three toilets in the house are now spotless and the kitchen is gleaming and they cleaned the kitchen floor which had a ton of cat paw prints all over it. I feel guilty for spending money to have some ladies in to do that when I am able bodied and have working limbs and all, but I feel like I can just breathe and relax looking around. If you‚Äôre not stressed by people rearranging things and can afford to have someone in, I cannot recommend it enough to help your state of mind.",0
First of all i got depression over 2 years ago. Im not the guy who talks to much about it. I dont mind to talk about it but i think it should not be the thing that dominates my conversations. What i hate is when people with depressions do talk sooo much about them and their depressions! That is so self-centred and their depression becomes some tool to get attention which is so annoying! This is at least how i feel. On a second thought i am like ‚Äûwow should i talk more about my depressions? should i open myself?‚Äú Im confuesd because i also feel like an asshole for thinking like this. Pls let me know what you guys think about this!,0
"One wrong text and destroyed a friendship we thought would exist forever. One fucking voice memo where I said something stupid. I totally understand why she now acts like she does, it‚Äôs all my fault why did I fucking say what I said and will never be able to undo it.. she was the only one I could talk to about everything, I might be able to live on for a bit but soon there will be something I would have shared with her and will be struck with the fact I won‚Äôt be able to ever share it with her FUCK FUCK FUCK",0
"The tip of my nose actually looks swollen. It's like a sphere instead of being just a little curved. The center of my nose petrudes out like there's something not growing right. It looks disgusting. I am really lanky. People say being tall is attractive but I manage to make it not. My skin is like vomit brown. I hate it. It looks so gross. It's all scattered with like mini-pimple things? My hair is some God forsaken mix between a bowl cut and something that doesn't yet exist, while tiny strands stick out everywhere. I hate how I look. I'm sorry if I sound petty right now but this sub-reddit is to vent right? I just want to spew my thoughts out here. I apologize if this seems pathetic. Now I feel like shit for feeling like shit about something so small. Yay.",1
"I'm suicidal every day and I'm pretty honest about it, and today my mom was talking about how she can't deal with me anymore and I asked her not to call me a burden cause it makes me want to die more and she said ""If you want to die so badly, you should kill yourself"". So that's great. Just another reason to add to a long list.",0
I feel terrible. Like something is gone but nothing is. I‚Äôm trying all my tricks to get me out of this depression episode but I just can‚Äôt find the energy to do more. What do you guys do to help you through?,0
"Hey all, I'm new to reddit and not sure if I'm posting in the right place. I have been on the SSRI ""citalopram"" for about six weeks now and have seen no improvement with my depression. I was wondering how long it usually takes until an increased dose is considered?? Thanks",0
"I get envious of my peers in college who are successes, envious of Youtubers with thousands of subscribers sharing their experiences traveling the world, and their awesome hobbies, etc. I want to experience these things as well, but I can't. I'm still stuck at school and home with no friends, and hardly any money to travel anywhere or do anything... I know we shouldn't compare ourselves to others, but why is it soooo difficult to stop? I try to block them from my mind, but always end up drifting back. Whenever I see these people, I just get this awful sick feeling in my stomach. Please, any advice would be appreciated...",0
"Hey guys. This might sound funny to you (it sounds funny even to me lol), but i'm really ashamed of my past. I'm 17 year old, and about 5 months ago I shaved my head. Previously, I had mid-sized hair and I was a cute guy, but when I cut my hair I looked really really bad. Some people even couldn't recognise me. But that's not everything - one day I got drunk with my friend and we shaved the ends of our eyebrows (yeah, we really did it), so I looked like a serial killer or a pedophile... I literally wanted to cut my whole head next morning. Few days later, I was at brother's birthday party and I took some photos with him and his friends, and one of the guys posted the photo of us on facebook. He didn't tag me, but he tagged my friend, who is in my class. He even put a cover photo with me and some other guys... Now, here comes the real problem... A few weeks ago, I met a girl through one of my classmates (not the one I mentioned before), and now we're in relationship. Now, I'm scared that he could maybe tell her about my hair-shaving, or that my girlfriend could find my bald photos (4 of them) on facebook. Yes, I know this is a really funny and strange story, but I don't know how to deal with this... I'm thinking about this whole day. That simply kills me, because she'll probably find them one day (and maybe even break up with me), and I don't know how should i react...",1
"She was just perfect, she liked me as well but then she said that what she felt wasn't enough. I'm really feeling like losing it, the mental health/sanity you know.",0
"So, hey. I'm coming to this sub because... I feel empty, again. I just took my antidepressant for the day, and I still feel like depression is creeping in. About two months ago, I stopped going to school. It was either that or, you know, a mistake. I had to breathe. Two years ago, I already took a break because of depression, and saw what I could be without it. It was awesome. And now.. I'm missing school again. I feel emptier and emptier, and dumber every day. A few months ago I was doing amazing things, considering becoming something i'd never even dreamed of. Now, I have all of the possibilities for a better future, and yet i'm sinking in the terrible depths of my stupid brain. I can't come back to a regular sleeping schedule ; I keep thinking wht I should do today, etc. But then, my brain stops me : ""Why bother ? Nothing is important. Your success, your creation, doesn't impact anyone. And even if it did, it would be but a speck on billions of people. You're just trying to fill your time until you grow old and ultimately be alone. "" Jesus, even typing this is horrible. But I can't stop thinking this is terribly true. I keep realizing i'm not intelligent. That it was something adults told me when I was young, I just rolled with it until the truth hit like a wall. And yet, my most happiest times were when I felt dumber. That I ignored the reality. I don't want to feel even stupider. I'm scared",1
"I have only been taking them for a few weeks. I have the same thoughts I had before that used to make me super sad and anxious, but now it's like I'm neutral about it. For example, jumping to conclusions about someone not wanting to be my friend for some stupid reason. Well now, I still think ""they must not want to be my friend"" but instead of going home and crying about it I just kind of shrug it off. Is this typical of anyone else's experience?",0
"i'm a freshman in college and although i have good grades, i can't help but feel as though i'm going to be a failure in the future. i look at my peers and almost all of them are more socially active than i am. i have next to no friends in college aside from one or two people i talk to in class occasionally. i'm not a member of any clubs nor do i feel particularly interested in joining them. i feel like i'm not as employable as my peers and it really frightens me. anyone else feel like this sometimes?",0
Does anyone have any tips? My friend cooked some delicious bacon-wrapped chicken and I took one-bite...I smelled the left overs today and I just don't feel like eating. This isn't just my friend's food. I made a big batch of meals for the weak and I can't bring myself to eat the prepped meals.,0
"he also made fun of me which hurt a lot. i'm 19 and i don't know how to drive,it's shameful really. thank you all for reading i was having such a good week but my dad ruined it.",0
"If I wanted to describe my life in one word it would be ""confused"". Nothing in my life makes sense, i've been searching for somewhere to belong and can't find it. I'm lost. -Culturally I don't feel like I have any sense of national identity. I'm British but I don't feel tied to that culture or any other. - Ethnically i'm mostly white, however slightly not ,so i've never felt at home in white society. I also notice many things about white society that are problematic. - Sexually i'd say i'm mostly straight. I've only ever been in love with women and sexually am only interested in women for the most part. However, I do sometimes feel affection and aesthetic attraction for some men, sort of like a crush but not sexual? This is another reason why i'm lost. - I don't like or relate to any of my family. - I don't feel tied to religion or atheism. - I've never been in love and can't seem to build connections with anyone. I feel so lost. I don't feel like I have an identity. I don't belong. I've always been depressed but I have no idea why. How can I find answers?",0
"I want to fucking fall off a high rise, I wake up and struggle to find a reason to get out of bed, I get on the bus, I cry under my arms, I get to class, I hold in my tears and put on a smile to talk to my friends, I cry in between classes, I go home, I cry, I go to bed, I cry, I'm sad as someone would be if their whole family died all the time, AND NOTHING IS CAUSING IT IM JUST FUCKING SAD. I've not talked about this because I don't want to put pressure on anyone, it's a miracle if I even hit enter and don't delete this message before you get online, I don't have any friends I can tell this, even you seem pretty fucking emotionally dull, our entire friendgroup isn't even emotionally attached. And the friends I have that I can tell something like this to are also depressed, and I especially don't want to put pressure on them. Don't feel required to be my fucking therapist, sorry if this is overbearing, I just can't stand all my friends not knowing anything real about me. I currently have no intention of harming myself or anyone else I can't even watch something even remotely connected to depression, I just fucking cry, I've been holding in all my feelings for so long and i'm having a mental breakdown.",0
"My brothers build computer for a living, my sister is great at coding, my cousins are engineers, and I can barely get a mini drone to work. The only things I can do is play games, D&amp;D (not as good as my siblings, might I add), and debate religion/ethics, all three of which are taken up completely on youtube so I wouldn't even get seen by anyone, and both were hit by adpocalypse so even if I were to get popular I would be demonetized instantly.",0
"I usually avoid toxic parts of the internet to not get even more depressed than I already am but someone [linked me to this text](https://i.imgur.com/8SmEePD.png) without telling me how bad it gets (so I'm warning you not to read it if you're feeling particularly bad right now). Some of the text feels like jaded ramblings but other parts feel like a punch in the gut. I'm 31, my career is a trainwreck right now, got no friends anymore nor a SO and parents are getting old so soon I won't even have a family. Parts of this text that talk about social capital really resonate with me since many of the examples it mentions I did experience before but couldn't figure out what was happening at the time. It felt like when you realize nobody was laughing with you but at you. But worst of all is that I have nothing to counter those arguments, in particular the ones in the first half of it. It was a very disturbing reading, at least for me.",0
"As I lay in med bed crying my eyes out because of this horrible depression, I, as always, try to call on my dog for comfot. I read somewher that they can feel if their owners are sad and will try to comfort them. Not this dog, he doesn't give a shit. He never wants to be close me unless it's because I have food or want to scratch his ear. I guess he can feel my negative energy or something like that. Man I suck.",0
"Hi, I started college this year after a gap year and I went to a major that I was really excited about and I was preparing for it. It‚Äôs arabic language and history major. 2 months in I knew something‚Äôs just not right. One of the teachers is really demotivational and the classes were really hard. But I kept going because it was my dream to go to this school. Now it‚Äôs finals month here in Czech and I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I suck at the language, I tried but I just don‚Äôt get it so I told my family and friends and everyone just says that I cannot give up! ‚ÄúYou have to go through finals! Give it a try!!! You have to push yourself and do the best!‚Äù But I‚Äôm pushing myself I guess I‚Äôm just not pushing as hard as everyone else. But I don‚Äôt want to push too hard. I‚Äôm already really depressed I started going to therapy because of the school, I‚Äôm crying everyday. I don‚Äôt think I can get through. Why is everyone telling me that I cannot give up? Why is ‚Äúgiving up‚Äù seen as such a bad thing for people? My long distance boyfriend is the only one who supports me the way I need. He is motivational and he‚Äôs saying that it‚Äôs okay to quit. But you know, he‚Äôs not here and even though he is my support I need something to tell my family or just people around that they will get and not see as a bad thing to do (giving up).

"I'm considered by close friends to be a calm and happy person. I never actually lash out on anyone. When I hang out with people I would say I am pretty fine. Then when I am alone, I get these intense feeling of anger over miniscule and insignificant things. Things like someone making a mean joke at my expense a long time ago, if they said/did something that made me shut down, or that time my roommate made a mess and I had to clean it up. These incidents can be months old and resolved, but they keep repeating in my head and I find myself getting increasingly angry. It got a bit better when I was on antidepressants (Citalopram) but I decided to get off them due to side effects. Does anyone get this? How do you deal with it?",0
"Can‚Äôt make anyone happy anymore, what‚Äôs the point? None of my friends care despite me reaching out and my fianc√©e is fed up with my depressive shit. Don‚Äôt even think he wants to marry me any more. I can tell he resents me. I can‚Äôt fix the things that are wrong with me. Why bother with anything? Don‚Äôt wanna upset my family so I‚Äôll just keep trecking on I guess. Just needed to vent cause I don‚Äôt have any real people to talk to.",0
"In my case it's my family and especially my mother who tell me that they can't deal with me and that they don't feel good either, which just gets me down even more.

"i have great parents and all, but they dont seem to understand a teenager like me. they jump to conclusions about what i am thinking. i told them about this once and how i felt suicidal at times, and then said that they would kill themselves if i did. obv dont want that so now im stuck in a nice prelude to what will be hell. what do i do? i feel like i exhibit all of the symptoms of depression(weight gain, less sleep, loss of interest, constant tiredness and negativity). i have some good friends, even if i only see them at school, and my grades arent bad either. im still not happy. maybe im spoiled. on a side note, does anyone else hate it when you have no motivation to do something, and then your parents say ""find the motivation""? i ask how, and then they say ""make your motivation"" LIKE DAMN.

Does anyone else ever just get really sharp spirts of anger when your upset?,0
"I always feared people's judgement. I never wanted to be known as the weird one or the outsider. I always kept to myself. No one really bothered me, but no one really cared for me either. I was in the middle, not bad enough to be hated, not good enough to be loved. I was content with this position for a while, but it was lonely. I would always sit at home, while others would go out and actually do things with friends. I would lament my existence, and question if I was ever good enough. The truth is I am afraid to just be who I am around people. I have seen how people treat others who are different. They can be mean and cruel. Their avoidance can hurt and damage, and their ridicule can cut and bruise. I have been on the receiving end of cruelty, and I would rather not go in depth about it. People don't accept me now, even as docile and non-aggressive as I am, so how would they accept me if I was myself? I worry they would think I am weird and annoying, even though I don't mean to be at all. I just want to be accepted and appreciated as I am, but I worry people won't agree with that.",1
"Hey. I've never been diagnosed with anything so I don't know if I'm supposed to post here, but I couldn't really think of any other place. What am I supposed to do about my worth? I feel as if everything I try is a failure and I convince myself of that fact. I can't handle any criticism because it consumes my entire mind and destroys any confidence I had to do something. I'm now finding it impossible to do any schoolwork because I've decided that no matter what I do I'm going to fail. I have no intimacy in my life and that makes me feel like I'm not good enough around my peers. It kills any confidence I have around people so I just try to avoid any social situations. I know these thoughts are unhealthy but I can't even force myself to try to get better. Maybe I'm just too sensitive and a pussy.",1
"I can't be the only one putting myself down all the time? It's like when there is a brightening in the air, I find something wrong mostly with my body and I get frustrated, angry and sad at the same time. It's like I'm not meant to be happy and enjoy life... It has made me lose my curiosity for life and all the things within it, understanding how something works, and I hate myself for it, as this have been one of the biggest drives for me in all my life. I could get excited just about a small idea popping in my head. Today no ideas are floating, my brain is empty, meds, depression or just myself? Even if some idea comes up I immediately put it down, because why bother? It won't work and if it does someone has already made something which is 100 times better than my solution...",1
"Most of the time it‚Äôs the opposite, but sometimes, when I get really depressed, I want to have sex or pleasure myself as much as I possibly can. I just feel worse afterwards, but I always do it.

I chased stupid pipe dreams of becoming a TV writer, and the stories I write are no good with any amount of editing. At my mom's pleading, I moved out of my apartment and in with her. Now I have no place to live and ""home"" is not my home. She just wants me here as someone to insult all day and then claim she's trying to help me by undermining my self confidence like she did for years while I was growing up. She always talks about how I can't do anything and guilt trips me into running her errands while she gets drunk every night. I want to just take off and go somewhere, but I have nowhere to go and no job lined up. I feel more pain every day. I just want to know how I can work up the courage to kill myself. My new year's resolution is to stop being so weak so that I can end it.",0
Im afraid. The suicide scale is true. Its gets progressively worse and you dont even realize it. I was at 1 contemplating death and that was it. Now as i live i keep moving farther into the scale. Not existing is all i long for. Its all i think about. Its all i desire. Ive written 2 goodbye notes. I constantly open up the lid of pills and acting as if ill swallow them. Yesterday and today i have been making nooses with a thin belt and putting it around my neck. I squeeze so hard to simulate what its like. When i do i can feel the pressure in the top sides of my head. I can feel the rush and fear. I stopped giving a shit about everything and my attention is mainly death. Someone please comfort me. I am afraid.,0
I have friends who except too much of me. They can't accept I won't get a job or a have a house or wife or kids.

"I went through a major depression and experienced a breakdown of sorts. Threw away a lot of awesome opportunities. While I'm back in control of my life (sort of), I feel like I damaged my reputation beyond repair, am mortifyingly embarrassed by my actions, and now feel so behind in life. Now I feel like I'm existing on the fringes of society, and if I don't change something soon, I'm going to be ""exiled"" to live a life of isolation, depression, and irrelevance.",1

Just nothing. Finally, I stop, for the last time. I take up my paintbrush of gray. I paint nothing, and e v e r y t h i n g.",0
"I might sound like a total nutjob but hear me out. Most of the time I start daydreaming and fantasizing about actually having friends (as if) and an interesting life, like in a cartoon adventure or something. Sometimes I even make up scenarios in my head with real life people about things that could've happened. It's starting to become more and more frequent and I'm finding myself moving my lips to the conversations in my head. Then reality comes crashing down and it feels horrible when I realize my crazy fantasies will never happen. It's just so much better in my mind. Anyone else?",0

On the other, I feel so bad about myself because of how much I *need* to go. How do I not burst into tears when I go in for my first appointment? Because I'm thinking that I might. What if my mind goes blank and I can't speak? How did you guys deal with this?",0

"Hi everyone! So I realized my depression is better at home, when I can be with my dogs. That‚Äôs partially because I have to take care of them. The thing is, at school, I can‚Äôt really have any pets- and I‚Äôm graduating soon which means I can‚Äôt have a new one right now. I won‚Äôt be stable. So I got a cactus! I‚Äôve never really taken care of a plant before so I‚Äôve decided it was easy enough. I have an app and she has a name- so hopefully this works. What can you take care of to help?",0
"Hi guys, I might need some help. I'm dangerously close to becoming a full alcoholic. Whenever I feel down, i grab the bottle. Sometimes I get drunk 3 times a week, the minimum is 2, but sometimes it's even 6 times a week. Just got out of an 11 day drinking binge. I'm only 18, I can't let the booze take over. My friends and I joke about, just because they don't know the extent of the problems and I'm too pussy to tell them. I just feel so much better when I'm drunk. I am smarter, more social, don't think about my problems as much (until an hour after the last glass, then the depression really hits hard.). I just always feel like I have wasted the last 18 years of my life. I have litteraly nothing to be proud of. It hits hardest when my friends asked what I've done all day, and I just have nothing to say. So whenever I'm down, I'll get drunk, knowing I'll feel better for a while. The depression itself isn't that bad, it's not always there. I feel perfect half the time. Dunno if it's even a real depression. Took half an hour just writing this, as I can't type correctly anymore, so I have to write the whole thing basically three times to make it correct. Again, I don't know if this was the right place to go, but I had to talk to someone about it.",1

If the year goes good(that means change in myself), the setting will be amazing, and i will enjoy the trip. If the year turns south, i will probably have a terrible trip, but the shrooms will teach me something. Maybe then, i can change.

I won't go to a psych because they are A) to expensive and B) paying someone to listen seems like I have to force someone to pretend to care about me. I'm 21 but I feel like im 51. Everyday I wake up I feel like im dying on the inside. I miss my girlfriend so much she made me feel whole for 2 months. I felt like I had a chance but even she gave up on me.

Often I have crying moments like tonight where i just think about school and start crying for minutes on end, it just makes me so sad, and i really hate it. Any idea what to do?

"I did well in high school, but ever since I got to college, my grades and my mental health have taken a dip. I'm sure this forum gets posts like these all the time, but how do you give yourself motivation to do well? I live alone, estranged from family, and I'll scrape along, making sure to stay alive, but I never really live. I'll make friends, but since I can't visit home, I'm usually stuck during summer and winter breaks alone. I have a job, but it's tied to the online school, so I don't really see anyone. I'm not suicidal, but I don't understand how people can just wake up with the motivation to run for class president or actually make a change in their lives. I still wake up in the morning, but should I? I can't do anything. Nothing changes. In fact, nothing interesting has happened in my life for a while, and I'm sure that's my own fault, but coming from a city and going to a college in the middle of nowhere, I have no Idea what to do.

I am having a hard time relating to anyone anymore about anything. I am always trying to fix it all, and I am always failing miserably, after all this time and all these years. It's always the same thing. It's like a funny story I have told too often. I still find it funny, but I don't laugh any more. I liken it to having a serious head cold that won't go away. It pounds like mad and all I can do is hope it runs its course. And, it never runs its course. The real irony, however, is as worthless as I feel, I still can't help feeling lonely.",1

It's like a thick layer of fog in the air or something. But anyway...I fell back asleep and woke up again half an hour ago about 11:30am and I had all these weird dreams where I had to sleep in my father's car while he was gone somewhere, another one where I was at my friends place depressed and no one noticed, one where I was drinking the same vodka that jacksepticeye was drinking on a YouTube video (wtf), one where I was running away from crumbling buildings and a few where I'd wake up in the dreams and still wouldn't be actually awake.

"And as much as it hurts and exhausts you, you let them. For me it's because the pain is better dealt with an ""ok"" than them becoming upset at my ""no, I'm not fine"" and starting an argument. It's just what I'm used to - I'm in a loop of an imaginary consistent bell ringing that reminds me to people please. For you it could be to feel, to feel the pain because you can't feel happiness anymore. Or because of guilt, your own and what others put on you. Or simply, it's because that's all you've ever known. I'm sorry. I really am sorry. I feel like I belong in a mental hospital with the thoughts that run through my head. I wish you all a better year in 2018, I really do.",1

I just knew they would stick around I guess. And they did. But now I'm even rejecting them. I've been out of a serious relationship for 4 years. I haven't hung out with a ""friend"" in 8 months. So I don't know, but what does this all mean? Does this mean I've got a lot of personal work to do?

"Has anyone ever felt like they didn't want to explain to their friends/family/spouse about how incredibly sad you feel. I don't know where my sadness comes from. I know I feel selfish because there are children dying of starvation and I cry alone for hours about nothing. I just don't want to explain to people how I feel. Have you ever felt so incredibly in a dark place that you feel it may be contagious. Like I feel that I am going to drain the happiness from others around me. When people ask me to tell them how I feel, sometimes I want to cry because I feel like I am going to drain their happiness with my sadness. It's like a black slime that's enveloping me and if I touch others with my sadness then it will envelope them too. I know that isn't true but it's just a feeling. I am trying to work and be a normal person but almost on a daily basis, I think how better I would feel if this feeling would stop. That I can't make this feeling go away and it's just a feeling that I always have. A feeling of loneliness even with people around. A feeling of sadness even though I have nothing to be sad about besides normal stresses. It's like constantly feeling sadness and you can't stop it. It's always there. Always on my back. Like a weight that I can't shake. I'm sorry if I cant explain better.",0
"I play on Playstation. The only friends I felt I‚Äôm actually close to (save 2/3 people at my school) are on Playstation. I hinted yesterday that I‚Äôm feeling down and made a few depression jokes etc. And they passed it off as me going through an edgy phase‚Äù. Afterwards the two calling me an edgy teen left until it was me and my closest friend online. He asks if I‚Äôm depressed shortly after the other 2 leave. I tell him everything. He isn‚Äôt the first person I told, (1 of the previously mentioned school friends was the first) but he confesses to me that he knows how I feel, and that he self harmed for about a month of his life. I was shocked. I didn‚Äôt know what to say. I guess know I kind of admire him for getting over it and going through it. I‚Äôm scared to tell anyone else. I have suicidal thoughts and tendencies, I feel unmotivated and cannot get to sleep. I also usually can‚Äôt get out of bed in the morning. I am too scared to kill myself but I wish I could just die in an accident. I wish there was an easy way to cope with it or beat it but there isn‚Äôt.

"Hi everyone I'm new to this sub but I just need some help with my change. For two years I have been actively self harming whether it was cutting or doing other bad stuff. I had friends that tried to help but I could never get myself to stop. Recently I found myself in a really positive relationship and because I love my boyfriend, I agreed to give him my blades and he promised he would keep them out of reach. I did this because I feel okay knowing they still exist even if I can't get to them. I could never get myself to throw them away. But now I am so utterly depressed. Cutting was my unhealthy outlet but I relied on it to feel better. Now I don't have any way to release or at least nothing that equates to self injury. For anyone who has successfully quit cutting, how did you do it? Because right now, two weeks in, I only feel so much worse.",0

I‚Äôm proud of my accomplishments but I always second guess everything. What if I did this differently? Why didn‚Äôt I do this better? It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I compare myself to my colleagues and friends and their successes and motivations.

How do I convince myself to be ok with where I‚Äôm at in life and gain the motivation to move forward? I feel so ashamed to have these feelings yet so jealous of the happiness and enjoyment my friends have in the things we do. Because of this I feel isolated and alone in my feelings and unsure of my future.

"after a 3 year hiatus of putting off medication and therapy, I finally made the dreaded decision to start again (just drugs for now I think, we'll see how that goes) and asked for my mother to schedule an apt. this is for severe anxiety, social anxiety (or avpd) and depression (diagnosed those 3 years ago). my mind is blank and I am not sure how to express / describe myself so that they can effectively gather information and prescribe the drugs they see fit. I'm afraid of freezing up and being incapable of speaking honestly. but knowing this is my anxiety speaking, it'll probably go well and be over before I know it... or it could seem to last an eternity and I'll feel trapped the whole time, as per usual. don't know why I've typed this. guess it would be nice to receive some advice, experiences, what to say, etc. not expecting replies though. gonna take a hot shower, then ponder about this until I fall asleep. goodnight. edit: wording.",0

"My mother has been depressed most of her life from what I can tell. She and my father are separated. He's struggling with his own battle. I'm 24 in college and I live about an hour away. I come home nearly every holiday, because when I was living at home during community college she became very dependent on me(to do household chores, and support her emotionally). She's lost her white collar job about a year ago. She make some bad choices, transferred to a position that wasn't right for her, and got let go. Now she's working at a warehouse job that too physical for her(out of shape). I'm worried that her depression is getting worse and worse. I can't quit college to move back and take care of her. Nor, do I think that is the way to really help her. Every time I come home her house becomes dirtier and dirtier. She's missing bills, becoming more reclusive, and I'm worried she depleting her savings/retirement. She isn't taking care of herself and not really trying to fix any of this. She's becoming more disillusioned with her job search for another white collar job. She is going to therapy and taking medication, but I don't really see any improvement (actually the opposite). I don't know what to do. I really want to help her but I don't know how without enabling her dependence on me.",0
Went out to a bar on New Years and ended up dancing singing and making out with this super cute random girl all night. We were popping bottles of champagne drinking straight from the bottle it was so much fun and the only intimacy I've had with a girl in probably over a year (I'm 22). I never even got her name or number but I'm so fucking lonely that I can't stop thinking about her. It's pathetic. She prob hasn't thought about it since yet I can't get it off my mind. I keep looking at Snapchat vids we took together too because it's the only fun I've had in years and I don't want it to end. Idk I feel like a fucking loser,0
"It was not to long ago until I realised how lonely I am. I hang out with same 4 friends every time who I'm not comfortable with sharing anything because they are immature and make fun out of every little thing their is. Girls don't want to hang out with me because I'm not a typical douchebag like almost everyone. I would ask them out just so we could chat, but that isn't working out. With that being all said I developed this ""someone"" with who I talk to. Coming from a religious family I have grown up to believe in God, so I think I relate this someone with God. I tell all my problems and I request they would go away. My problems only got worse and worse so one night when I was on the edge of breaking down I realised I'm actually talking to no one but myself. When I actually came to this conclusion I fucking broke down pretty hard. Tears were running down my face and all I could think about is how much of a baby I am. I started hitting myself so it would go away. When I started to physically hurt myself I told myself it's enough, go get some help. I know the internet isn't the best place to be around in a situation like this, but there is still enough hope left in me for me to believe there is someone who can relate to me. These are all new stuff I'm experiencing since I never had problems like this. Sorry for the long post, but I actually think I'm going mental.",0

"22m. I take treatment for anxiety and depression. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs helping or not, because some days, both before and after starting the SSRI, I feel normal and friendly, others I feel angry and unable to have a conversation with anyone because I fear talking to other people so much, and also because the thoughts and images in my head are racing so fast I cannot slow them down fast enough to collect a thought to speak. I only answer either ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù on those days. I could have a few normal days in a row only to have them followed by a week of being afraid of everything. My eyes have been also more sensitive to light lately, if that means anything. In the background of all this is a strange sensation that I‚Äôve been told by several people is only a symptom of depression. I have no emotions or interests. I don‚Äôt want to talk or see anyone. Nothing in the world around me seems real, I don‚Äôt recognize myself or my thoughts, and I feel as though I‚Äôm watching myself go through the motions of life. Thoughts of my death and killing myself randomly enter my head every day, sometimes for no reason at all and other times is I‚Äôm uncomfortable or embarrassed, but I‚Äôve never thought seriously about harming myself. It‚Äôs more as though it‚Äôs a thought I observe and don‚Äôt interact with. I don‚Äôt know why, but my day-to-day thoughts make me feel as though I am an aged older man than a 22-year-old.

"I've been dating this guy who treats me like a million bucks- and respects me, my opinions, makes sure we talk everything through when there's an issue, voices his feelings, asks me to see him in person when he wants to bring something up so there's no misinterpretation, brings me flowers on my hard days at work, answers me, always, notices all the little things, like my random upper cheek dimple, the way I bite my lip when I'm concentrating, and how I tuck my hair behind my ear when I'm nervous. And here I am, unable to feel strongly about him, never responding to him on time, flaking out on seeing him, constantly. Compared to a year and a half ago, when I was incredibly head over heels in love with a guy who broke my heart multiple times, used me and manipulated me, barely respected me and ghosted me. We accept the love we think we deserve, right?",0
"When something bad happens I can tell myself hey that sucks but it's just one thing, next thing will be better. Then something else bad happens. Then again. Then I break my nice electronic equipment. Then I feel like overdosing on all my meds. I don't want to live as myself. I can change some things about myself but in the end, the core of myself will always be here, and I hate what I see. My dad just wants me to ""get better"" and stop living off him, which is ok. But when I'm a broken, autistic shell of a human, it's nearly impossible to want to get up and do what I need to to live. I just want to get some heroin, a tent, and go live in a gutter till I eventually die. I cant live without getting high on *something*. I just want weed but noo my family doesn't understand so they won't help with that so I'm slowly dying from a mixture of cough pills and OTC pain meds. When I'm dead they'll just blame the drugs, not all the constant conflict inside and out of my mind. I would just pretend to kill myself but it wouldn't do any good. My mom would say ""maybe we should try these herbal supplements..."" And my dad would say after a week ""alright time to get a job again, the world doesnt stop for one person"". So whats the fucking point, I'm just as trapped and hopeless as I've ever been.",1

"I have a lot of interests outside a depressive episode, but maybe the most unusual is a fascination of old abandoned buildings, malls, houses, amusement parks, etc. I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôm into it but I think I like the mystery that surrounds it.

We were just talking and I said something idk what but she took it to mean I like her and I do but I know she doesn‚Äôt so I had no plans to tell her. I fucked it up. She‚Äôll barely talk to me. She was the last person I had. Idk what to do now. I feel sick.,0
"I'm not sure this is the right subreddit but I need some outside opinions. Some backstory: I'm currently attending college. I have a body focused repetitive disorder that popped up around early high school and has since been a lot better. I've always been a bit on the depressed side since middle school with low self esteem. One reccuring thing is in certain situations I become very stressed (?) to the point where my mind just digs itself into a hole of despair and I have episodes of just crying and feeling extremely awful. Most recently, I've been triggered by my boyfriend. At first it was just arguments over random things we disagreed on and slowly the crying episodes came on. Eventually I think it's just instances of him being mad at things I don't do on purpose but are sometimes wrong and me feeling so bad about myself that I get into that mind space and can't get out. He thinks of them as tantrums and doesn't know how to deal with or help with them. Even at home, when I think too much I focus on all the bad and this happens again. I start doubting my relationship because of all the bad stuff, I start feeling bad about my life etc. For the most part I really like my relationship. Outside of the arguments we fit together really well. He's very sweet and caring. Does anyone know what I might be experiencing and how to fix it?",1

"I was recently diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder, OCD, and depression. I met with a on-campus counselor and after several sessions I was referred to a psychiatrist, and after several meetings with him and with other professionals I was finally diagnosed (took almost a year). The fucking issue is I can't get help at all, all of the psychiatry work was done at a near by mental hospital. And the counseling was done on campus, I was referred to several therapists/psychologists/specialists/etc to continue work but I don't have a car and counseling on campus is very limited in the amount of sessions you can do (10 per 2 semesters/or per issue). So I'm fucked because I can't afford any of my medications because I'm a poor American and thus don't have healthcare and can't afford medication, I don't have a car and there a no therapists near by me that I can walk to or ride the bus too.",0
"Today I finally got the strength to finally get help with my depression. Still trying to figure out the logistics of when my first appointment will be with the doctor but I‚Äôm proud I am taking a step in the right direction. I think my slide into depression the last 6 months is from the loss of my dad as well as some other personal issues (hated my job/fallout with some friends/bad breakup) but it took 6+ months after all that for me to finally realize I needed help. I was sleeping in, just watching tv/playing Xbox and avoiding my friends at times when I started to feel anxious. I started becoming more and more of a recluse but at this point I‚Äôm done with this feeling. I have gotten a new job and mentioned to my boss that I might need to show up an hour late on Fridays for my therapy. She couldn‚Äôt have been more understanding and supportive of it. I was nervous as hell to tell her but glad I did (depression hasn‚Äôt effected my work, in a weird way it‚Äôs the one part of my life I have felt empowered/productive). Sorry for this rambling but I am only posting this to hopefully encourage others to do the same. I know everyone‚Äôs depression is different you can get help. I also know I have a ways to go and this is only a small baby step. I have been lurking at this page lately and have been moved by the posts I‚Äôve seen.

There‚Äôs a lot of further background information that I‚Äôm too tired to get into. Suffice to say, this is extremely painful and I‚Äôm not taking it well. Similar things have happened to me constantly. Why is it ok to do this to me? Why don‚Äôt I matter?",0
I just entered a new phase of depression. Cant go to sleep when i am not extremely tired because of thoughts. My mind is cluttered with great amount of sadness and anxiety and when I lie down I just cant make it quiet so I stay up until morning . I dont think I will be able to go on much longer,0
"Nothing Happens Staring at the white wall I trace the rectangular patterns with my wet eyes and the pain strikes me again along with the voices. ‚ÄúGaby, you‚Äôre such a fuck up why are you even alive?‚Äù I cover my ears while I shake my head repeatedly. I lose control. In a plane falling out of the sky what can one do but brace for death? Every negative happening that‚Äôs ever happened is replaying in my head, spun around where I‚Äôve become the problem. The angle of death. The one thing that makes sure everything goes wrong. I see this seemingly true image of myself and I feel disgusted. The voices start yelling ugly words at me digging at my festering wrists. They wanna see blood but I wont give it to them. My whole body shaking, little puddles of tears on the floor, eyes like a madwoman the voices start screaming. Banging my head against the wall until my fight for survival becomes a fight for death I slump down, my head throbbing with a sharp pain in my skull. I laugh. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too quiet in this restroom.‚Äù",0

"We had a rough day. You know, when you and your significant other argue. Those types of days. But what happens when you think she's lost trust in you? It's a worse feeling than some of you think. Maybe then, that's not necessarily a bad day. Some people have it worse. Even I know that. But sometimes it turns into something a little worse. The truth was, was that I hadn't been talking to anyone else. I had swore up and down that I hadn't been, I mean, she was on vacation and I had promised to always be faithful. And I had been. She just didn't understand the real truth that I had been telling her. She wouldn't believe me. I made bad decisions. This seems simple to anyone else who'd be reading this. We argued some more. She blocked me right before I had gone to shower and that's right around when I realized some things. I realized that I was a bad boyfriend, although I had always been faithful and loyal. A bad friend. Moments later, I could feel that familiar pattern of water patting on my back as it does every night right after my usual 5 hour shifts, every day. Zoning out, I kept realizing why some people hurt themselves. Why people killed themselves. Sometimes the sky is grey much more than it is blue. Maybe it was people like me. Maybe I was a bad person after all. I wish I could've been someone better. So, in that case, I'm sorry.",1
"Sorry for the very melodramatic title. The point is, i have suffered from depression and I have gotten over it about 2 years ago, but everything that goes a little downhill in my life spurs this fear that I might not be able to be ""normal"".

However I am interested to see if anybody who has gone through depression has this same fear of going back into the cycle.",0

I'm also semi-seriously making career / retirement plans, and thinking about the futures of my parents and niblings and sister and in-laws. But none of this has any substantial meaning to me.

And no new habits have been formed.

It‚Äôs like if I‚Äôm enjoying myself heaps, like laughing with friends or watching cute animals, and realise that I‚Äôm having fun, and that thought triggers myself to say to myself that I will never be happy and this is a fleeting moment, and that thought itself acts as ‚Äòevidence that I‚Äôm depressed‚Äô which goes back into the cycle of negativity which de-purifies whatever enjoyment I‚Äôm feeling.

"I‚Äôve lived with depression for so long that it feels weird not to be depressed sometimes. I don‚Äôt like it. It‚Äôs almost as if I need my depression because it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm comfortable with. It gets me through my ruts in life by making me feel nothing. But at the same time, it‚Äôs so pathetic. It keeps me from doing things I enjoy, and it makes me feel worthless and hopeless. It makes me think about suicide a lot too because I start to think about my future, like what the point is in living or if I can really handle anymore pain. (What is the point in life anyway? Work until you die?) But then it gets even worse when I realize I can‚Äôt end it, because of personal obligations based on relationships and religion. (Plus I‚Äôd never get to finish dark souls.

The only reason I still am holding on is because of my religion but then again I still want to end it all. I want to be better but I have no one to talk to or to help me. Today I told my mom how suicidal I feel and how I want to kill myself and she just laughed. Made me feel like shit. That's why I don't talk to anyone about how I feel. I guess I'll bottle it all up and let it explode sometimes in the near future. Maybe then I finally will get the guts to kill myself. For now I'll just keep bruising myself. I'm done with this all.

"That's it. This isn't a new year's resolution because that shit is nonsense people tell themselves to feel better. I'm GOING to beat this shit. The last month I can confidently say has been THE WORST month of my life and I have been through A LOT OF SHIT during the last 27 years of my existence. At least during those times, I wasn't depressed (somehow). I know what I need to do. I need to find a therapist who understands what I'm going through. I must have been chipping away at a mental wall I built up or something all this time because it finally came crashing down after a series of thoughts and I NEED to tell someone about it. Someone I can trust. The fact that the simple thought of it gives me hope and makes me feel better means I know I'm right. I don't think it's a chemical issue in my case. It's a cyclical one, only eased when I drink several cans of beer before inevitably passing out since otherwise I WILL be up all night - no question. For the first time in my life I am ""looking more forward to"" (phrase used loosely since there aren't many things I can truly enjoy lately) work and this annoying festive vacation to end because I won't be alone with my thoughts. I WILL beat this. I HAVE to. And to anyone reading this post who feels the same way you CAN too. Sometimes, there are some things in life we just can't beat alone.",0
My boyfriend dumped me yesterday and I was very depressed and down so I asked my ex's friend if he wanted to hang out and talk. We met and had coffee this afternoon and we talked and laughed. At the end he hugged and kissed me on the cheek and asked if I wanted to hang out tomorrow. I said yes. However after I got done with work tonight I was extremely irritated and stressed and just wanted someone to talk to. I asked if he could come over and he took me to a restaurant to get food. I asked him if he could stay with me for a while until I felt better. We went back to my apartment and talked about stuff. I started getting really sad and started to cry. He hugged me and I told me that everything will be okay. I just really wanted love and physical attention at that moment so I kissed him and I climbed on top of him and straddled him and we made out for a while. Why can't I be alone?,0

"I wish I had the courage to open up about my depression. It's my birthday today and it feels like the most miserable day of my life. 21 years old and nothing to show for it. It eats me up inside when I bottle up my emotions and I desperately want to talk to my friends and family but I feel like it would make me a massive burden, or that I'm just looking for sympathy.",0
I feel as if I‚Äôm depressed but I can‚Äôt express emotions. My entire life I feel like I‚Äôve been pretending and imitating emotions I‚Äôve observed. I feel like some sort of AI trying to pass off as human. I don‚Äôt feel sympathy towards others but do my best to act as if I do. I understand emotions and know how to reciprocate them but it feels like I‚Äôm reading from some book. I feel the emotions sometimes well up inside me but I can‚Äôt let them out and eventually they fade away into the emptiness. I‚Äôm not sure what I can do but I must keep pretending. I have hope that I will find purpose and freedom to express myself. I wish the same for you all.,0
"Today would have been my best friend's 18th birthday, we'd be going out together for the first time, we'd be sitting here making resolutions for the new year that we both know we'd never keep. None of that is even possible though, because he's gone. It was never supposed to be like this.",0
"So I couldn't feel any worse, and I've had enough. Tonight, at midnight I am going to message this girl I have absolutely minimal contact with (see my utterly pathetic first instance here: https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/5krkd4/after_years_of_denial_i_finally_have_to_admit_my/) and say: ""Yo, my resolution is to be more direct and meet new people- what'dya say?"" It will be the biggest hail mary I'd have ever pulled. It will either crash so tragically that the fireball would likely engulf the entire planet, or I'd feel liberated and freed from my own inhibitions.

"Hey guys, I've been depressed, anxious and introverted my whole life but I've kinda learnt to live with it. Recently since I don't sleep much and I have a lot of down time to myself I consume myself in my thoughts. Yesterday my girlfriend dumped me, it was genuinely sick, we had been dating almost 7 months and when she dumped me she laughed and smiled and treated me like shit. It was also my birthday. I loved this girl, I put in so much effort to be a person suited to society and not an overly cynical, disfunctional boyfriend in order for her to like me and so I could find happiness. I'm sitting here now writing this because I have no one, I feel physically sick with the way she is treating me and how once again she has abandoned me. She is fucking with me, ontop of all the bad shit that has recently happened to me. I can't function now, I feel so helpless, I don't know what to say or do, I constantly feel overwhelmed with anxiety. I haven't been this depressed in years. This is such a dark place and I have no one. I just want to end it. Please anyone give me some advice.",0
"Hi guys, Never even used reddit before but a close friend of mine suggested asking for help on one of these to keep anonymous. Recently I've finished school and turned 18 (adulthood in Australia). For about 12 months now I've had massively interrupted sleeping schedules, and my body is used to only getting 4-5 hours sleep, sometimes able to function on 2-3. In the last 4 weeks, my thoughts tend to become darker, I feel the sensation of suffocation and drowning (I'm crying as I type this..) I hate the thought of professional help (counsellors/therapists) but I may consider it soon. I have a loving yet dysfunctional family, 2 brothers and loving parents. I live in a good home and have a part time job as a cashier in a supermarket that I've stuck to for 2 years. I'm waiting on university offers and if I'm lucky I'll be moving states to Melbourne City in Victoria for something along the lines of Law/Business. I can't shake these awful feelings, my brain feels continuously sick. Recently I've been experiencing alot of anxiety, something I've never ever felt before, usually I am confident and outgoing. Very recently, my job has made me feel extremely anxious and sometimes I hyperventilate if I'm lacking sleep and feel like I'm sinking even lower... its 3:10am on New Years Day as I write this. I don't know how I feel about disclosing what I think triggered this depression, but I will say I received an unexpected diagnosis after collapsing during work about 3-4 weeks ago. It's been downhill ever since. Please help, happy to answer any more questions, and sorry if I've broken any rules; I'm new to reddit.",0
"Hello. I am 22 years old. Me and my family are suffering from a severe depression over things that has happened in 2016. Starting from october 2016, I've started writing a public diary in Tumblr, hoping that this can actually help relieve this opressive feeling. Has any of you tried doing something like this and if so, is it helping you?",0
"I **need** this year to be better. I'm nearing the end of my third year of college. The new semester is approaching quickly, and I desperately need a good one in order to save me from failing. I failed two courses last semester. I was miserably depressed the whole time and it showed on my GPA. That was my free pass; I can't afford to fail any more. If I do, I won't graduate on time. If I don't graduate on time, I don't graduate at all because they'll cut $8000 of financial aid and I can't magically come up with that money myself. But this year doesn't have to be like that. I don't believe all of the bullshit about how the new year promises change and hope. It's literally just another day, except the year is different. Still, I'm mildly optimistic. I've never been a hard worker, but that has to change now. I know exactly what I have to do to be a successful student; doing it is just impossible sometimes. My depression is like a roller coaster. Before Christmas I felt amazing, and now I feel empty and broken inside. That worries me: if it comes back in full force in the middle of the semester, that could cause a great deal of damage. Regardless, I wish you all a great new year. Hopefully this one won't be quite as shitty.",0
My greatest solution has always been to just sleep but these days I can't even do it that easily. Second best was video games but no matter how happy I am for my character I will always come back to the fact that it's all virtual and real life isn't that beautiful. Music was also something that helped a lot but I have no mood to play or sing and listening to it makes me sadder most of the time. Being at work has helped me take my mind off things but when I get home it's the same thing all over. It really feels like there's nothing else to do so I'm hoping that you guys can help me out. Lots of love to everyone.,0
"Normally i feel threatened by ''good-looking'' people and such. But when they show weakness or some traits that i deem not good, weak whatever, i get a feeling of disdain for that person. It's almost never on an even level. I am better or worse than someone. Anyone familiar with this?",1
I keep hearing them exploding close to my house and I get startled everytime. There's not a sound in my room but then BOOM. Firework. I'm getting so frustrated I'm at the point of almost crying. My heart and the back of my head hurts and my chest feels tight. Why are there people that need to plant fireworks at 6:30 pm??? There's still almost 6 hours until midnight. As if I didn't feel bad enough for spending today alone doing nothing. Sorry. I needed to vent. But screw this day and fireworks. Happy New Year though.,0
"But he wants to walk through them. It's an... oddly fascinating view I see when I look at myself outside this black bubble. I've dragged down those who are closest to me, because maybe they know, but I've never felt so grateful towards anyone for merely existing near me. I'm much more ready to get happy seeing something than I was, and maybe this was due to some desparation to get out of the vantablack-coated hellhole that I fell into, but slowly I started to look at life as string of vignettes, with a moment of quirky charm thrown in sporadically. I'm still far from escaping this pit, but were it not for moments like those, I'd have stopped this nonsense a long while ago. It's made me appreciate things that I've never cared about, even if moments where I truly smile are few and far in between. Someone once read me this: ""Even the dimmest spots Would now feel bright For only in darkness Do you best see light."" Happy new year guys.",0
"I hate to be negative but I am just super tired. I've been pretending to be okay, happy, normal since I was 12. I've had breakdowns but it was easy to pretend I was okay and I could get through them because I was in middle or high school. I had my biggest breakdown in my life ever in January. And nothing has changed. I still feel the same. It's been 12 months and I'm just even more tired. I don't even feel anything anymore besides the occasional crippling sadness/loneliness. I binge and I don't feel anything anymore. I buy things and I don't feel anything anymore. I've been struggling and working so hard to change and nothing has changed. I honestly can't keep living like this, and I can't keep living if I will never be happy. I don't know how to be happy. I need someone to talk to, I don't have anyone. I pretend all the time, nobody thinks anything is wrong with me.",0
"I have no reason to feel this way. I am surrounded by loving family and caring friends but is there a reason for me just listening to slow music that appeals to me personally most nights and just feeling sad? I haven't really felt 100% for a couple years now, but no one i know has an inkling of what's happening to me, cause i think i hide it quite well with humour and when im socialising, it grants me temporary relief from these feelings of self doubt and loneliness, but always, when im alone these feelings creep back in and i can never seem to be rid of them. I've never really had much luck with relationships, i had something serious a couple months back, which actually stopped my lamenting, but it fizzled out pretty quickly and the feelings returned, and magnified with each failure to communicate with any girl im interested in. And now i sit here by myself, again, watching the fireworks from my window as my family sleeps and with music in my ears, just feeling.. sad. I don't really know how to explain it or why I'm like this, so i figured i may as well share and get outside opinions on it. Im not searching for a solution, just a means to understand this P.s if anyone's actually interested the music i was listening to was the exis mixtape by roy woods and free 6lack by 6lack",1
"This has not been a good year for me, and has not been for a great amount of people, there is a great stigma towards 2016 as being a shitty year, but how many people actually lost something this year? Yeah celebrities died, blah blah, I'm not being apathetic, they were good people, but how many people actually cared about them? Every single time some big name dies, people fill their facebook statuses talking about how x was a big inspiration for them, how x helped them greatly, thing is, most people didn't give a flying fuck about them in the first place, but virality hit them and they didn't want to feel left out of it, facebook is nothing but a big viral circus for the ego, pseudo friends and ads. I'm tired of being told my depression is chemical inbalance or some other bs, I love life, but I'm tired of being pointed as the culprit because for sure I'm trying, how many times I messaged facebook ""friends"" and they were downer as fuck, only replying with fillers or excuses, nobody wants to hang out, most people don't want to really connect anymore, they want to live out their digital identities in real life, real socialization is basically dead, everyone is racing towards who's got the ""better"" social condition, who's got more likes? who's got more photos? I'm not exaggerating, instead of a simple gathering, hanging out, doing fun stuff, chat about life, everyone now hangs out to chat about other people, chat about material crap, chat about bs, chat about how they got fucked x amount of girls, or how they achieved y stuff, really fuck off with this crap, everyone likes to conversate about mundane crap, people don't want to exchange ideias, they wanna show off.",0
"I'm 18(M) and turning 19 in a month time. I've been having depression since late Jan 2016 which started because of an extremely bad break up, financial issues, parents divorcing thus having to move out as well as performing badly in class. i'll try to keep the post short and simple because I'm exhausted right now, typing this on mobile doesn't help too, especially for formatting. Any advice from those who have/had depression would be greatly appreciated. Well, just ranting for online does relief everything in which I had bottled up. So on new year, I just broke up with my girlfriend(4months) and connections from my close friends. My relationship was toxic as it felt as though I was the only one trying as I clinged onto the thoughts that she would be the one who help me to get out of depression. She was initially really supportive and that was why I was attracted to her, she helped me to elavate my abuse of tobacco but I feel as though I'll fall back into that sinkhole. People change and I don't blame her. She feels exhausted and does not feel the same way anymore. Right now I'm just really exhausted of everything. I have scheduled appointments for a psychiatrist that was done by the SAF, Singapore's Army basically. I don't know what to expect besides perhaps being announced as clinically depressed. Does a psychiatrist really help? Any response would be greatly appreciated. Have a happy new year guys, I hope that you guys will have a good year ahead",0
"I'm at my girlfriends house, us and her parents are going to have a big dinner. But fuck me I'm so exhausted from this week and can't feel happiness whatsoever. They play the fucking music too loud, I just want to be alone and play video games so nobody annoys me on fucking New Years Eve. I hate this day, too much noise, too much fake bullshit. But of course nobody understands that one can feel exhausted from hanging with other people for a few days, so I'm the ungrateful asshole for wanting some alone time. Fuck my life",1

"It's six hours until New Year here and I just want to curl up and die. I've had depression for as long as I can remember but it recently has become worse. My boyfriend of 2 and a half years (who I live and work with) broke up with two weeks ago. Tonight he has gone to one of our colleagues house parties, I wasn't invited. No one invited me anywhere and I don't blame them. I'm not angry that he went, I am angry at myself. I have no friends, live miles away from any family and at the age of almost 28 have nothing to live for. I try to stay upbeat but I really don't see the point. I've alienated myself from everyone and this is what I get. I just want it all to be over.",0
"Hello. It's almost time to celebrate the new year where I live and instead of going out with friends or a loved one, I'm getting ready for work. That alone wouldn't be that bad if not for the fact that I'm a busboy. I work at a bar picking up glasses and wiping tables. Tonight the bar will be packed with happy couples and groups of friends. For the record, I am 19 years old, male and incredibly lonely. I've never been in a romantic relationship and I don't see it happening anytime soon. Normally my job is unbearable to begin with. But tonight will be especially difficult. Having to not only watch others enjoy their life and celebrate with loved ones, but to also have to clean up after them. I think tonight is the night I kill myself.",0
"1. ""You just have to wait for the right time. Stop trying. You're still young. You'll find the right person eventually."" This is literally just you pushing the problem off onto whoever I'm with the next time I'm having a bad day. And not everyone does fall in love. I find it more likely I'll be dead before that ever happens. 2. ""You have to love yourself before anyone else will love you."" Then I guess I'm fucked. I don't love me. I despise me. So does everyone else. That's why I'm here. 3. ""Being in a relationship won't fix your depression."" No shit. But you know what, I'm pretty sure having someone around who tells me they love me and hugs me when I'm sad sure wouldn't make things any worse. 4. ""You just gotta get out there and meet more people."" Rejection is a bummer, but if you also get the occasional date from trying, then it makes up for it. The problem with that is that the people like me who only ever get rejected feel even more like shit and don't want to put themselves up to that repeatedly. I'm sure there are others that I have grown tired of hearing, but I can't think of them at the moment. Basically, does anyone have any actually helpful advice for someone who is struggling with finding love?",1
"Part of me wants to go to a big NYE party/event tonight, because that's what normal people do on new years - right? I would spend a bunch of money on taxis, booze, event tickets etc.. all to be *normal*. That's what I usually do, but I'm not in the mood for it this year.. It all feels so pointless to me now. Sure, it'll be depressing knowing that everyone else will be out tonight having fun, but it's all so superficial; get drunk, yell happy near years, feel like crap in the morning and resume regular life the next day. No matter what I chose to do I'll still be depressed. I don't want to celebrate with strangers, but I also don't want to be alone tonight..",0
"Is there anyone else here that has so much but doesn't feel like they really deserve any of it? Personally I've got a few really close friends from home and college, a great GPA, a good job, a family that probably isn't as bad as I think it is, and we're getting by financially, even if it is a bit tough. I think about my situation compared to some of the others I read on here and I question why I'm so depressed. Even with all that I have, I feel like I don't deserve what I have, and someone who can actually enjoy them should have them instead. Thinking that I'm the one who gets it instead just makes me feel worse about it really I wanna just throw it all away, disappear without anyone knowing where I went but I know that won't fix anything",1
"Someone loved me and I think I loved them, I was so happy, then she was gone and I was awake. I laid in bed for more then an hour trying to just fall back asleep, I wasn't tired, I just wanted to go back. I can't even remember her name. Seems so stupid that I would care, she was just a dream. I've never felt like that before, didn't even know I could, doubt I ever will again. Now that I'm awake it seems like a nightmare rather then a dream. Just a terrible glimpse at what I am probably incapable of feeling in the real world.",0

"I've only ever had one friend that I can tell anything to, but I've always hid my depression and various other mental issues from her. But she knew something was up because sometimes I go weeks to months where I don't leave my room more than once a day and barely eat or drink don't talk to anyone and lose whatever job I have at that time. And finally last night I told her everything and she was the first person to not down play my problems or end the friendship on the spot. She told me that she will be there to support me through everything and even told me she liked me a lot. But I'm hesitant to start a relationship because every relationship I've been in has ended after a month at most because of the way I am and I don't want to lose her as a friend. I do feel a lot better having finally told someone about my depression and other shit. I might ask her out anyway because she is the first girl to fully accept who I am.",0

So I have depression and anxiety that I take medication for, it's been going well helping me however I am quitting college (to help alleviate the stress and anxiety in my life) and will no longer be covered under my parents healthcare so I will be paying for my medications out of pocket. I currently work a minimum wage job and my medications can run hundreds of dollars per month that I wont have. On another note she found out I am taking my depression and anxiety medications through the pharmacist (Im 19, is that even legal?) and told me I was not depressed nor anxious enough to be taking medications.

I don't get extra hungry, but I crave chips and popcorn. Stuff like that. I masterbate a lot more. I don't necessarily want to sleep more, but I like to lay in bed more. I get antisocial.

"Basically, I'm a girl who turned 18 in november. I've struggled with my mental health for as long as I can remember (I started self harming when I was 12, but I managed to stop when I was around 15 or 16) and this year it's only gotten worse. My friends don't want to be around me anymore because they say I'm too miserable, or I'm ""always in a bad mood"". I suspect myself of having depression and I find it incredibly hard to get excited or happy about anything at all - I seem to have two modes of indifference or unhappiness. Recently (especially in the holiday season) my thoughts are consumed with how much I want to die, how much easier it would be and how little a lot of people would care. That, or many of my ""friends"" whom I thought the world of but I've since come to realise are only friends with me through circumstance, would suddenly care when they are nowhere to be found right now. At this point I have stopped trying to open up to my friends. I took a couple weeks off school last month in order to get my head straight and when asked why I hadn't been in, it very quickly became a competition of ""who has it worst"". I do have one friend who means the absolute world to me and I feel like I could tell him anything, but there's only so much you can burden one person with. I've thought many times about how I could kill myself and I have written notes out for my closest friend and a few other people - at this point, it's just finding the courage to do it.",0
This year has been complete hell for me I turned 22 I lost my girlfriend of 4 years she broke up with me by handing me the custom necklace I got her.. I fell thousands of dollars in debt from helping her with everything she needed from phones to car payments. I met my best friend fell completely in love with her thought she felt the same way so I asked her out she turned me down. everything was fine (I just loved her company) until 2 weeks ago she started dating and I never really see her anymore and is now about to move away.... I'm stuck living with my parents who tell me how everything I do is wrong how I should have a 50k+ income how I should have moved out 2 years ago becomes it's easy to afford to live. I can't afford to move out alone I truly thought she loved me and we were simply going to get a apartment we even talked about it a lot to the point we looked at some.. I'm ending 2016 thousands in debt alone and depressed knowing there will never be anyone there for me when I need them my few friends I consider family and I would do anything for them (from buying tires to food to giving them a ride) and I like to think that they would be there for me... but this year has shown me that's not the case that non of them truly care about me... I've been sleeping all day after work crying slowly realizing I have no one even as I write this I'm realizing that.,0

My friends are having a potluck, but I just want to sleep. Last time I hung out, I didn't feel like I fit in. It takes so much energy to leave the house. What do I do here? I can barely function. :( I was taking Adderall and desipramine before, but last term was rough. After school ended, I stopped taking the Adderall, as I noticed that I grew tolerant to it. I'm scared to try another medication. I don't really want to go to this potluck, either. I just want to sleep.",0

If someone breathes in the wrong direction I can't help myself I completely lose it. I am so stressed out but I really can't figure out why. All I want is to run away and be left alone. I've been like this before but being in the UK mental health services are absolutely dire so I was just told 'what do you have to be so depressed for? You have everything to live for!' and stuck on a waiting list for therapy which I waited 6 months for and it was totally pointless. This time I won't even bother turning to anyone for help. I can't stand being around my husband because he asks if I'm ok every 5 minutes when I just want to scream at him to leave me alone. I can't stand being around my kid because she does my head in and I have zero patience for her. It's neither of their fault, it's all me, I don't deserve them. I am a waste of space and oxygen.",1

"I have so many things that make me feel sad, especially right now, but I don't talk about them with others, even though I have some lovely friends, because I don't want to place the burden of myself upon them. Even though I have no evidence this will happen I am gripped by the fear that they will think I'm annoying (oversharing?) when I think about telling them this stuff, or I start to think about how maybe they will abandon me if they knew how sad I really was. I think that talking about stuff sometimes does make you feel better... just to unload that stuff. But I feel like I'm really making people suffer by telling them and so I end up suffering alone. What do I do??? I honestly need an appointment with my therapist today, but I have to wait till the 3rd and I feel like stuff could burst out of me before then that will alert people to my depression which I don't want. And all this is made worse by the fact that I'm not actually diagnosed. My therapist said it's not pathological what I have, but I feel completely alone in my thoughts and feelings all the time. If the act of me killing myself wouldn't affect people like my family and friends, especially my mom, I would have done it already.",0

I can't keep living like this anymore the last 3 months have been hell... what a bad way to start a new year.",0
"Well calling them friends is just nosense. I said to them that i was sick this last day of the year because when i'm out with them they are just making fun of me because i'm 1.70. To my parents, i said that i would go out and they went at a restaurant with other people. Lol. All went down after high school. I'm so done, i'm gonna play some league of legends. Best wishes to all of you",0
"I'm using an alt because earlier this month someone went through my post history and harassed me for posting here. Literally every interaction I've had on this website lately has been shit. It seems like every person on this website is an aggressive, closed-minded asshole.

"It'll be 2017 in 49 minutes. What a year 2016 has been. I lost my girlfriend of almost three years. The business I tried to get going failed before it even started. I got back in touch with the one girl I ever truely loved. Now we don't talk to each other anymore - but at least she found her someone, and she's doing better now. I'm not. I don't have any friends to get drunk with tonight. So I'll be hitting the gin on my own until I pass out and hopefully I'll choke on my own vomit. But I digress. What I was trying to say, apart from telling the whole world 'O how I'm sad, is that I know plenty of you guys and girls are in the same position. Remembering that we're together in our loneliness is creepily heartwarming. Here's to hoping for a better 2017 - but it won't happen, right? So let's hope we find bliss in our sleep never waking up again. It'll be 2017 in 42 minutes. Finishing the year as it started. Happy new fucking year.",0
"I want to be able to be be and do more in my life, farther my career, move someplace better... but i feel like I'm not capable of it, like it's impossible for me to get better at anything and it frustrates me, I wanna learn more things but i always feel overwhelmed and panic that i can never learn it and my head just shuts down... so i feel trapped and useless and i can't get over my anxieties at trying to improve it... this is so hard man...",1
"I've never really liked this time of year and I don't know why. It seems like bad things keep happening to me when we're supposed to be happy and celebratory. This year it's my friends moving away...I'm like the sith because I have my own rule of 2 in that I really only have 2 friends at a time. This isn't really by choice it just seems I can never get close to more than 2 or 3 people at a time. Anywho, both of them moved really far away in the last few weeks. The only people I was going to have to spend New Years with were my parents and as a 27 year old that is already depressing but now they won't even make it home till tomorrow night due some travel mishaps. Now I'm feeling really alone and isolated. I know I'm not really alone but I'm already really down after my friends moving that being alone tonight is hurting me badly. Reddit has always been there when I was bored hopefully it can be there for me when I'm feeling hopelessly alone too...",0
"I don't know what to do. I feel terrible! I'm so blank and I have a heavy feeling in my chest. I feel sad. I keep spacing out I just want to lay in bed and sleep. I hate being awake, I hate not being able to feel happy. Why am I sad, why do I hurt every fucken day? I feel so lonely. Everyone thinks I Amncrazy for being depressed. Nobody ever understands me. I always feel like a burden to everyone just for being sad. They say to cheer up or to stay distracted, that it will pass. It's easier to have a reason for being sad but when you don't even know why you're hurting- it's so unbearable. I have no one in my life who understands. My mind is breaking. I'm breaking. I feel so crazy. I try to win but I'm always losing to my self. I hate my thoughts. I'm so afraid of how I'm feeling, how nasty it fees to be depressed. I can feel every single negative emotion creeping up all over my body. There's time when I just want to go to a psych home. I'm afraid of what I'm becoming. I hate who i am. I'm nothing.",1
"About two months ago I started working my first retail job at a grocery store chain, and everything was fine until they decided to move me to a different department that I can't stand being in, as well as changing my hours completely. Most people say that the front end isn't that bad, but it is for me. They won't let me move somewhere else, so I decided I wasn't going to deal with it, and ghosted instead of giving a two week notice like you should do. I've been lying this entire week about going to work, and instead I've been reading books on mental illness at my public library and staying there until my ""shift"" is over. My mom wanted to know my shedule for next week, and I showed her that it was empty, meaning they fired me, but I didn't tell her that and she thought they were just giving me the week off, which is an impossibility in retail. I start college in two weeks, and now I won't have a paycheck coming every week, but I can't bring myself to care all that much. I noticed I've been much more reckless when driving by myself lately, too. I almost got T boned after leaving the library yesterday and felt nothing. No fear. Just nothing. I wish I could work at the library, it's usually quiet around there...",0
"I'm terrified of going out and spending time with my old friends from high school. I just stay at home all day and wonder why I'm so lonely. There's always this feeling that I want or need something, that it's just out of reach, but I don't know what it is. Sorry just had to post",0

"Hey ya'll. I'm okay. I'm trying to be okay with being okay. I've been trying lots of things lately, and I'm certainly seeing the results of my bravery. I've sobered up. I just got a job that I'm super motivated about, and I think after a few weeks I'll really be able to rock the shit out of it. All in all, I've learned a lot about self-care and self-love in the past month. In the grand scheme, I feel like I might finally be out of the rabbit hole, and can finally get my life moving again. But at the same time, I feel alone. I finally accept myself again, which is the most important step. But I feel like no one else wants to share the riches if found within myself. I'm a pretty cool guy, I make pretty cool music, and I'm pretty damn funny. But I have no one to sing for, and no one to make laugh. And as much as I appreciate my own company, it would be nice to have someone who values me as much as I do. That might come off as egotistical, but hey I'm a human being and yeah I have an ego. Sometimes I still need someone to take care of me, and I feel like I'm coming up short. I could really use a companion right about now. Some one to let me know that it truly is worth it to try to be the best version of myself. Someone more than my mom and my mirror. If you're alone tonight, I might be too. So let's maybe not be alone?",0

It's birthday depression all over again. Laying around knowing that it's another year and I'm not in a better position that I was in last year, and I genuinely dislike so much about myself. I'm stuck here, feeling miserable, and knowing I have to go out tonight and be social so I don't end up sitting here alone, probably drinking by myself and inevitably hurting myself. Fuck. Whatever. This is obnoxious and I just needed to vent. We'll get through this bullshit. It's just another day. Fuck.",0

"I am 27 Male and separated from my wife. We have two kids together which are ages 5 and 6 both really great kids that I love with all my heart. I've been separated since fathers day and it's been tough on me as I see her with different guys and the one she's with now she claims she loves but that part that gets me is we've had sex once we kiss and grope each other and we had another experience where it almost happened again. If that's the case and she claims she loves this guy then what the fuck is going on? I can't keep doing this, she's put me through so much shit. My oldest son is not biologically mine but I stepped up and stayed in the picture and till this day he sees me as father/daddy, that's a huge step right there. Deep down inside I know she wants me and she sure as hell knows I want her but what can I do to make it happen sooner if its going to happen because I am so miserable without her and my kids. To tell you the truth I don't even know why I am so in love with this woman. Please any help would be greatly appreciated and for those of you who aren't going to help and just be dicks please don't bother because this is hard enough on me as it is. TIA.!",0
"That's so embarrassing, humiliating and so frustrating especially on these last days of holidays. I mean, this person is with his/her loved one, people she cares about.

"So right now its 1 am on the first day of 2017 for me having been woken by some fools that actully celebrate such a thing with fireworks. Now I could write such grand things here like: - Every choice we make will in some way lead to pain. - The human condition is a curse. - If I have nothing to look forward to in the present or the future and there is no afterlife, what am I supposed to work towards? but the bottom line is that I feel sad and angry about how I am currently living my life and I have no intention of changing it because I don't want to or as I would rather put it to make myself feel better: - Because I see no reason to. - Because nothing will change for the better even if I try. - other stupid excuses like the ones above. So here's to a new year of all our personal hells, the only wish I have left is that I won't have the chance to say that again.",0

"Just a sense of impending doom, this year is going to be shit. I felt the same last year and I was right, 2016 was awful. Things aren't getting better, I'm starting to think things never actually do get better.

"I met this guy 2 years ago with whom I became best friend (although honestly I probably fell in love with him). He got back with his ex last year and since then I've just been spiralling down. When we're together, he keeps texting with his bf, and we barely have interesting conversations (we used to always hang out together and talk about everything). He keeps saying that he's my best friend, and he keeps saying that I'm very special to him, but he doesn't really act that way. Their relationship is long-distance and when he's with his boyfriend he barely texts me. I tried distancing myself, but he's scared he's gonna lose me so he doesn't give me a lot of space. I spent last January-March severely depressed and ended up seeing a therapist. I managed to get out of the darkness, but these days I've been faltering. Especially since he's with him now for NYE and I'm stuck with my parents and I don't expect myself having a good time... Lately we haven't spoke much and I was getting him out of my mind, but he sent me a picture of a gift his boyfriend gave him yesterday and my heart has been turned around. I feel like there's a hole, and yet everything is very heavy... I'm getting the same feeling I had when I was depressed. I keep getting the feeling I should simply ""break up"" with him, just tell him to go away, but when I think about that I start choking up and my chest just gets heavier. Sorry this post is sort of messy and all over the place, I just needed to vent... It's hard, very hard. Happy new year to you all, let's hope 2017 will be better",0
"I have taken a few tests over the past few weeks and it turns out that I have ''moderate depression''. Only one friend knows about this and he doesn't give a poop. I wanted to kill myself earlier before New Years but I couldn't do it. Ended up throwing my phone off the balcony instead of myself. I can't speak to my parents, I don't think they'd understand I want a way out, of loneliness.",0
"Now an again I feel so alone, empty and that I have nothing going for me. I use to go out with friends every weekend, play sports etc but now I spend 99% of my life inside and do nothing. A year plus ago my doctor put me down for anxiety and gave me some pills and i felt ok after awhile but lately I just feel the same. This time I don't feel the self harming will be enough. I make excuses when friends want to do something as i just don't want to go outside. There are all off having familys and i'm here doing nothing. Ive been seeing the doctor recently for passing blood and apart of me wants it to be something serious. I found some of my olds pills and i'm just going to see where the night goes....",0
"Looking back, I am literally in the same spot I was a year ago (physically, as well as mentally), at one of my best-friends houses, sitting at this pc, about to play some league with her. And thats it. Im still as depressed, probably even more now, Im feeling just as awful about being here, and more with every second. I was hoping I'd find the courage to check out many months ago, but I failed to find it. Perhaps, this will finally be my year... oh well, happy new years anyways I guess",0
Recently made a post about how I was going to stop self harming it's now 12:45 no one has wished me a happy new year not my parents or the freinds I believed cared about me. This has just showed me that no one truly cares and I'm about ready to give up I have spent the last year when I was at my worst making sure that I made the people I work with happy and when I needed help the most I have been forgotten by everyone I have never been so upset and let down I no longer care about faking a smile fuck everything,0
Does anyone else feel this way? When I'm at work I can't wait to get out and relax and not have to deal with the stress. But when I'm not at work I feel incredibly lonely and depressed and can't wait to get back to work to keep my mind off of things. I'm afraid to move out of my parents house because I feel I will be a miserable wreck on my own. I won't even have the comfort of my own family to come home to. Anyone have advice for this?,0
"Maybe I Should post this to suicidal watch or whatever. But I prefer you people.

Why the fuck should I be polite to people that I dont give a fuck too even my own family. Everyone Is fake. Hi how are you. Like you give fuck or they do. Just get straight to the point mate. haha Like why the fuck am I forced to live a never ending nightmare. Or ur mum would be sad etc why the fuck arnt they happy that i am dead. Don't they want me to end my suffering. I cant live much longer like this its rotting my brain. I started cuting my self and u know what it actually feels good. Hopefully in the future i can take it a step further and actually kill myself. Sorry the rant but why the should i be here im not going to make a differnce i have no hobbies I dont enjoy anything so why the fuck am i still here... I legit appreicate all the people that volunteer there the people that need rewarding yet most of them are struggling with dead end jobs legit.I just want to die its that simple but im scared of the pain why isnt there a easy solution. sorry for the rant and gramamr blah blah blah haha hope u peeople have a good new year unlike me :^)))))))))))) go get wasted people :)",0
"I'm new to reddit as of today. Recently, my depression has been super bad and I've been hoping for some other support besides the usual ""but your life seems to be going well"" and ""dont be to hard on yourself"" that I get from my parents. I dont really have anyone I feel I can connect to, so hopefully I can find someone here that is going through something similar. The few people ive talked to about it tell me that I have no reason to be sad because Im super high in my class rank, get high grades, got into a college with some big scholarships, and have been first chair hornist in my school band (or they say im just stressed out, which i am, but its just adding to my depression and making me feel even worse). Truth is, I have never really fit in or connected with anyone at school, leaving me with many shallow friendships and no one I feel I can trust. Work isnt any better either. Minimum wage for a shitty retail job and the only coworker who i got close to and who could understand me refuses to talk to me now for literally no reason given. Hell, im only 17 and I already feel stuck in an endless cycle of anger and disappointment that im going to be in stuck in for 2017 and the rest of my fucking life. If anyone is going through even a somewhat similar situation please let me know because i feel so alone with this.",0

"Ever since Trump, and everything that's come with it... I'm just tired. I envy those people who can see some supposed light at the end of this tunnel. It's all black and dark, and honestly? Who knows if I'll even be alive by the end of these four years? For now I'm grateful just to have my healthcare, but who knows how long that will last. It's not like anyone would mind if yet another autistic with disablites was dead, since apparently I'm just a 'cancer' to society, riiiiiiight? /Sarcasm/ It's like like is a collective joke and everyone's laughing, but I can't see the joke. People see hope in this man, but all I see is a clone of my abusive father. I see a man that hurts people, and is in power, just like dad was. I don't see anything to hope for. I see nothing but more reasons to dissociate and start reckless habits. I just see nothing to look forward to. I'm sorry.",0
"On his deathbed in the hospital, he pointed at me, shaking his head and said, ""You're no good."" That was 9 years ago? I've always thought that it was all nonsense, I don't believe in the whole 'dying person's prophecies' as my family calls it. But now that I'm in my early 20s, still plagued with depression, and having a mindset of not wanting to work... I'm starting to worry that I'm starting to turn out as the 'no good' person my grandpa said that I'll become. I know fate is our own to carve, I don't want to get into the whole determinism VS free-will debate but I believe that we should all be responsible for our choices. And right now, although I'm still employed, I have seriously considered quitting several times, and what's my reason? I'm tired of work. Real tired of working. My only consolation is that I'm thrifty and sensible. BUT, my dad spends a lot thanks to his illnesses, cigarettes, lottery and luxurious meals, EVEN THOUGH WE'RE POOR. Sigh... Life is a meaningless trudge, we all die some day, so why can't I die soon? Maybe if I know that I'll die soon, I could quit my job and not worry about saving for retirement! Wishful thinking...

"I've been through some rough times now, just entered college and couldn't talk to anyone for a while... Against all the odds, I managed to befriend two great guys, one with an incredibly positive posture and one that shares my pain. I've been thinking a lot, as always.. and maybe things can change now. I am changing habits, thinking stuff through and making solid routines. Maybe I'm not such a waste of space. What I mean is, I've been there. And even though it seems like the cause of the suffering will never go away... There is a way to cope with it. In a healthy way. Maybe you are right that nobody can change your mind about your existential crisis. If God doesn't exist, then there is no right or wrong etc, etc. I still haven't changed my mind. But maybe, just maybe, I can still be happy. I guess this was just a vent or something. I don't know. It may sound cliche, but my change in view coincided with the new year's eve, so I may as well grab the chance. Happy 2017 for you all, and don't be shy to tell yourself to change to the better, even slightly.",0

"Seriously. I am literally doing better externally than I ever have, and yet there is always this hole in me. I have eight months off of drugs and alcohol, if I do either I'll spend at least six months in jail, but I want to so fucking bad. Just to feel anything at all. I'm so fucking undesirable as a person that I push everyone away. The meds don't work. I don't like anything anymore. I just have to stand and smile as everything I cherish leaves me. I'm going to die alone. Happy new year.",1

So now I'm alone at my house with Chinese food and beer. This past month I've felt more alone than I've ever have and i don't know how to deal with it. I'm starting to realize my place in friendships as the excess, the one who is forgotten or dismissed. This NYE was the icing to the cake. I'm hoping that 2017 will be better but it's not promising. Does this feeling of loneliness ever get better? Im scared that if I don't do something about it, it'll spiral out of control and that terrifies me",0

"I feel really awful about it. It's actually really eating me up inside... I feel like such a loser. Not so much that she ditched me, but that I'm alone, as usual. I'm mostly a loner except for this person so it feels like shit to just be alone when I know I shouldn't be.",1
"Organizing my thoughts enough to make this make sense is difficult. I have a bad habit of trying to smoke and work my time away, because on the clock is the only time that I'm not exhausted and angry. Neither of my two current jobs keep me busy enough, so I've started searching for a third. I've stopped smoking weed for the search, and now the depression is deepening again. The smallest things make me want to rage endlessly, destroying everything around me, but I don't even have the energy to waste on being angry. I've never let myself consider suicide or self harm, so I'm stuck in a shitty nihilistic spiral of hating to live and living to hate. I feel like my only desires are to pass the time until I can die without hurting my loved ones, and to minimize any negative impact I may have on those around me along the way. I figure if I can't be happy, I might as well not bring others down. Edited for legibility.",0
"So, been a long time since I posted (used throwaway but now I don't care) Basically, I was really depressed, I self harmed and attempted suicide once. After a while I decided I needed some company so I got a girlfriend. That in itself is an issue so I'll summarize it. She and I were happy but she said she was still in love with her ex. Thats when I realized I wasn't really happy with her. I broke up with her and was genuinely happy. This was about a mont and a half ago. Depression was gone and I was the best I could be. Then my friends started saying shit behind my back, that I was a fake and didn't have individuality. Basically mean things. Besides my friends were still (and still are) best friends with my ex. Like all of them.I started becoming left out. they stopped talking to me. (Literally the only chat I have with another person is my one true friend (Who doesn't respond to any of my messages even though he talks in groups) the rest I haven't had a chat since beginning of december) I keep telling myself that its okey. That I don't need them. I am probably right, But it feels really shitty. And to top it all of, my depression is coming back. I can feel it creeping up. Thanks for reading all this, You are probably the first people to care for me since vacations started. tl;dr friends ditched me, depression is coming back.",0
"My parents and little sister left an hour ago to go to a party. Im home alone and have been walking around my house picking out spots in the house that are capable of holding a 180 lb male. I dont even know how to tie a noose and im going around laughing at myself while saying ""Thats no strong enough"" or ""That could probably hold my weight"". I got rejected a couple hours ago to someone who i now realize doesnt care about me. She claims to but I know she doesnt. She acts just like how Ive been acting for the past 4 years pretending to be happy whenever someone else is present. I don't think my parents would care if I did rid myself, every night I hear them talking about how stupid and worthless I am but during the day they pretend like they care alot. I know they dont. Funny thing is whenever I think about ending myself I dont get sad. I feel some kind of joy, some kind of hope. I have attempted to take my life 5 times so far (I will spare you details) however I have a different feeling about attempt #6. I think it might actually work, which makes me happier than almost everything else. I am lucky to go 5 minutes without thinking of suicide. I have an amazing life that people would kill for yet I feel empty inside. I have ""friends"" but I can tell that they don't care about me",1
"So, here is my deal. Im successful. I am in great shape. I have a good life. However, i have 0 self worth. 0 Self esteem. The worst. It's been this way for years. **Backstory** Severely abused as kid. Then when i got out, I would over react to situations like a psycho. Extreme over the top protective responses to minor things. I never hurt anyone, hit anyone, but was a hot emotional mess with how i handled things. Learned to manage that with years of therapy. Additionally, I would often find myself in relationships with women, who were horribly abusive and did some pretty shit things, further hurting my self esteem that i would allow my self to be treated like that. So, i guess i feel since that I have allowed people to treat me as if i had 0 self worth for so long, that i feel like new great people wont possibly feel different. Additionally, I have alot of anxiety that alot of people may think I am crazy/emotionally unstable if tot hear of some of my situations in the past and i have stopped interacting with new people simply out of this fear. i guess my difficulty, is that if i was overweight, I would feel like atleast i could put a plan into place where i could logically lose the weight and help me feel better. however, i have maxed out everything that i can improve that way(body, finances). I have to change the way my mind works and honestly, it seems impossible. any thoughts/help/advice?",1

I'm healthy I have an OK job that gives me free time and extra money. I can't seem to enjoy life anymore and I can't fake it for family anymore. I don't see the point I think i don't want to live anymore.,0
Earlier this year my uncle was looking for someone to work for him. The job was very interesting to me. It's the kind of job I was truly interested in. Long story short I needed to go to school for a course that took 4 months to work for my uncle. Once I was done with the course my uncle told me he had already found someone else. But here's the thing. He's the one who found the course and told me to go and do it. I was so ready for the job and I feel so frustrated that I did the course for basically no good reason. It really felt like my golden ticket for a better life and now I can't find a job anywhere.,0
"So this is what happened in the past 6 months: 1. Lost my car to a hit and run 2. Lost my job due to an illness that's out of my control 3. Had emergency surgery to remove appendix and ended up staying in the hospital 3 days due to complications 4. Instead of visiting me, girlfriend dumps me the day I leave the hospital I just need to build up the courage of not caring about others and how this might effect them. This world can't hurt me anymore if I don't let it. This whole things is after 3 of the worst years of my life. I thought my girlfriend and I were going to make it and someday get married, but that was also a lie... This world is just not meant for me, and I can't wait I finally get the courage to check out permanently! Hopefully I can do it before 2017. Otherwise I've failed something else I said I'd do. I needed to put this out there so at lease I can go with a clear conscience. Thanks for listening, and good luck with your own battles.",0
"I am in the hospital. I suffer from several chronic illnesses and have spent the whole year here. Only 22 years old. I graduated from college a year ago and haven't done anything since. I was a model, a news anchor, a girlfriend, an aunt, a sister, daughter, friend, and now i'm none of those things (besides a sister &amp; aunt. but i never see them.) I'll be dead in 2017 due to my illnesses. I have decided to end my life tonight before midnight. I have a lot of drugs at my disposal-enough to kill a horse-and no one checking on me until morning. I'm doing it. My mind is made up. My depression from these illnesses is the deepest sense of hopelessness i've ever felt. I do not want to die, but living this life is unimaginable for any longer. I want to get married, work, work out, pursue my dreams, have kids, have pets, help others...but i can't. so what is the use in living as a vegetable? I cannot do it anymore. I just wanted to post this here because i have no one. Oh, and i'm ""social media famous"" because I'm pretty but no one knows how dead inside i am. I tried. I made it a year. But no longer",0
Woohoo. Got blown off by the same girl two nights in a row. I don't know why I expected anything good to happen to me. Really hope 2017 is my last year.,0
I spent so much time with my friends and they invited me to everything. I invited them to do stuff. We had a great time and we did everything together and talked to each other about everything. Now they have ditched me. I never get invited to anything. It's like they don't know me. I didn't do anything differently they just stopped inviting me to hang out. I don't get it. I'm not even depressed now I am just at the point that I don't care anymore. So now I have gone in one year from being kind of cool with everyone then being really awesome and fun and everybody liked me and I was invited to everything to now not being invited to anything and none of the people that were my friends caring to ask me to hang out. I didn't do anything different. I was myself the whole time. They liked me for years and then the moment I feel like they are my 2nd family I get cut off.,0
I spent mine crying in a dark house by myself. How about you guys?,0
It keeps getting worse and worse.,0
"I'm a girl in my mid twenties who has two friends, a job that's steadily decreasing my hours, no car, and no real hobbies. I've struggled between keeping myself entertained, keeping my depression at bay, and balancing my anxiety with my attempts at socialization. But I feel like no matter what I do, I always end up feeling alone. I used to be parts of groups, used to make friends in school, used to have things to do outside the house. But now I feel like I'm going through the motions of each day and not taking anything away from them. The worst part is feeling alone when I'm surrounded by people. I was out just two days ago and almost immediately wanted to head home. I've always considered myself an extrovert but lately I've found it hard to connect with people. Even in my own home, where I have a few roommates, I feel like nothing I do to interact with them is ever enough. One of them is obsessed with his video games, one is barely ever home, and the other one is dealing with anxiety issues of her own that I always feel like I'm bothering her when I try to hang out. And now the icing on the cake is last minute cancelation of our New Years plans (for valid reasons), but then instead of the four of us watching the ball drop together, everyone went to bed early leaving me yet again alone. Now I'm ringing in the New Year crying and writing this down, hoping if I make sense of my crippling loneliness, then there's hope in 2017 I can do something about it.",0
"I've felt proud of my success in overcoming most of my depression in 2016, and at least making some progress in seeing most people as good. But the end of this year has really taken a toll on me, especially after the election. It's not because of who people voted for, but because of all the horrible things on the Internet that resulted from it! I've always taken comments a little more seriously than most, but why not? If people express what they're really thinking on the Internet, than how can you trust anyone? How many people are friends with another race, then talk s*** about them online? How many people lack empathy for others? How many people condemn others for trying to speak out against hate? How many people really care? Despite thinking all this, I've still resolved to being a kind person and trying to understand others, even if their way of thinking is unfathomable to me. But i don't know if i can keep up the faith if this is how people really think. I just want people to be caring, but i know it's not as simple as that. I thought i was getting better, but i just don't trust people anymore. It doesn't seem like anyone really cares.",0
"I feel like im at the end of my rope. As the new year starts i am 13 mins alone by myself. I have no close friends around. I have no inclination to go out and ""meet people"" I just want to go home after work or on my days off/weekends and do nothing then feel like crap for not meeting people which starts the cycle of self loathing over and over again. Sometimes I think of hurting myself, or killing myself. the one thing that stops me is knowing that it would only hurt my family, and my clients. I work a lot and love my jobs (work with special needs individuals) and i will not do that to them. if did not have my jobs and my clients who love me i would do something but i do n0t. I just dont know how long i can go, will i make it out of 2017?",0
"I'm a 20 year old male college student. Before college and the year and a half hell I've been living in, I always felt like happiness did not come easily to me. I recognized early on that unlike my friends, I had to actively work for any semblance of happiness and peace. Once I started college, my old friend sexual performance anxiety came back full force and hasn't left. Being at one of the nations biggest party schools and mecca for beautiful girls my age, feeling left out of the one thing that all human cultures around the world share feels bad man. This has created a gaping hole inside me that I fill with booze and pot. I've been at rock bottom for a while now, and I know that recovering from this depression and involuntary celibacy will be the hardest battle I've yet to fight in my life. I feel like a morbidly obese person who has to lose 300 lbs but hasn't started yet. Everyone who loves me encourages me to fix my life, but looking at life, society, and the human condition from rock bottom changes you. After you tell yourself you'd rather be dead a certain amount of times, your outlook on life and the universe as a whole really does drastically change. When I look into my future, I see years of battling this dark and disparaging side of me. Why do I have to work so hard to subject myself to the daily delusion of being a human being in the modern world?",0
"I don't remember not having this and it's not going to go away. Even my boyfriend thinks I'm toxic and I can't count the amount of times I've hurt him, my family, the people I care about over the last year. I've given up on anything getting better. I have a way to stop hurting now.",0
"Yeah, so...2017 has begun and i'm sure this depression will still kill me little by little in the inside. Will be 4 years since life became a total shit, when everything changed so bad...the same place, the same motherfucking job, no gf, not enough cash, the worst thing which is i left my studies, oh, and the same bullshit everyone tells me: Everything will be fine, it's just a bad day, at least you have good health (i wish...), you seems like you have everything in life (ugh...). Well, that's all i have to say, i just wanted to share my thoughs on this place, sorry if I offend to anyone...",0

I'll be fine some days, but then something might happen or I'll get in my own head and things get so much worse. Before I've been able to deal with it, but last night something happened and I felt truly and utterly alone for the first time in my life and I wondered what I was even doing here. Why I'm living when I'm doing nothing with my life. I'm tired of feeling so terrible and convincing myself that I'm just a burden, but I don't know if there are places to help me.",0
"I want to believe next year will be better! I want to feel the joy of my family who says that so many good things are to come... but why do I feel so cynical, so annoyed, and so much like crying instead? I wish we were all together tonight.

Wherever and whoever you are, you are in my thoughts and heart tonight. New Years is never easy. Goodnight reddit.",0
My husband and I just had a huge argument and he stormed out. I should be crying or stopping him or something. But I decided to take a handful of benzos instead. Now I just hope I can sleep. I wish I could sleep for the rest of 2017... Happy fucking new year.,0

"I'm a high school senior and my high school experience has been quite rocky to say the least. Not only am I quite socially awkward and have close to no friends, living with my parents has made my anxiety and depression worse and worse every year. They don't accept a lot of things about me and I'm constantly berated by them. Their marriage isn't great either and a lot of times, they displace that anger onto me verbally. It's New Years Eve and I'm in my room alone, since they were arguing earlier and I dont have any friends to hang out with. The only thing thats keeping me going is knowing that this is the last new years eve that I'm stuck in this hell. I will be moving out next year for college as an adult. I will finally be in charge of my life and its going to be up to me what kind of environment i will be in. I won't constantly be subjected to their bullshit anymore. I will still have my issues with depression and anxiety; ive accepted that its never going to change.

Well I've made some great friends, found success with women, got two well paying internships, and I still want to fucking die. Its all bullshit. What do you do after 7 years of trying to make it better? I started working out, stopped smoking, got help with ADD. none of it has helped. I thought bettering yourself was suppsoed to help? All I can think about every day is when I am going to kill myself. All i want to do is go to sleep and never wake up. To be honest im surprised Ive made it this far.

Naturally attractive people didn't do anything to get like that, they just happen to have good genetics.

"Been doing really bad this year so far. Today I've had multiple anxiety attacks, breakdowns and panic attacks. This morning I spent about 3 hours straight crying, shaking and twitching. I'm going through some pretty heavy stuff atm. This morning I could hear quiet static. It sounded quiet but it seemed to completely mute any thoughts and I could barely move my arms to grab onto something. I couldn't think and I was just really confused. I keep hallucinating that someone I know is standing in the doorway and then my vision goes blurry my head hurts then everything returns to normal, I start crying again rinse and repeat.

"2015 was the exact same as 2016. 2014 was the exact same as 2013. I feel like I'm in fucking limbo and I am invisible. I never get invited for things on new years. Also, nothing ever changes. Nothing in my life changes each year. I feel like I meet with the same people, do the same things, eat the same things, never get luck with romance, etc. It's all a waste of fucking time! Why waste time to celebrate the same year with the same shit as the last. I never get out of the same places, people, and situations. It's all the same. I hate it. The only thing I enjoy is getting drunk on the new years and that's it. I'm only 19 and I feel like nothing will change in my life. My life will probably be the same when I'm 30 years fucking old. Nothing exciting. Every girl rejects me that I like. Every guy rejects me that I like. No romance. Nothing. Well, good night. I hope you all had a great new years and I hope you all have a great year. I don't my own year cause I know it will be the same.",0
"warning: fairly negative post. Feeling lonely &amp; not having friends used to bother me a lot. I thought having people reaching out &amp; caring about me would help me feel better about life. Then I started a program in college where everyone is really ""tight"" with each other. So now I'm not totally isolated like going weeks without talking to people, like it was before. These people are nice, fun &amp; share the same interests as me. There's no reason I couldn't be friends with them. But these relationships don't make me not want to erase my existence anymore, or pull me out of a shell, more confident, cheerful every once in a while, ad nauseum. It's not that they're ""not enough"" or something, it's just that nothing can fix me. I guess this past year has really proven that to me. That element of ""I wish ____ would just contact me, it would prove I'm not worthless and someone cares"" is gone, and it's honestly a relief. Kind of like sinking into a somewhat comfortable void. But it definitely scares me for the years to come. I'm supposed to live for 60+ more years like this? I'd rather not.",0
"Probably the most depressing year of my life. This is the year my cat died. The year my parents found out about my depression, we did nothing about it, and now we're moving on as if nothing happened. The year some of my favorite celebrities died.

Here's hoping 2017 will be a better year for all of us. The bar isn't set very high...",0
Can I trade bodies with a straight white boy. Nobody is into me because I'm black. I'm drunk and done with existing. Maybe I'll just black out and die. That's the dream.,0
"Honestly 2016 has been a pretty shit year. Being a gay 17 year old, with no father, moved halfway through high school and stuck inside his own mind with depression is awful. Lately I just feel like I have no friends or value in this life. Everyone who I thought I was close with no longer speak to me and Idk what I've done. I'm stuck in the middle of Nebraska too. I'm from the northwest and I'm stuck in buttfuck nebraska. I just feel so alone and worthless and I just wish I had someone to talk to and I just wish I loved myself cause I've hated myself for the past 7 years and not a day goes by that I don't overly criticize myself. Honestly it's new years and I wish a drunk driver would hit me",1
"Today I got a message from a friend saying she had tried to kill herself so I, and my wife, offered to come get her. She admitted that she'd been using oxy again and drinking a lot, so we brought her to our house. We've handled situations like this before so we were prepared. The problem is I've been fighting like hell to keep myself out of depression after losing my grandfather in October. She's been drunk since she got here (she drank a shit ton before we picked her up) and has been saying pretty mean things. I know she's drunk and over emotional right now, but I feel like an idiot for taking on the responsibility of helping her when I'm not even in the right mindset myself. She went on for a half hour about how it was pointless to try to better yourself because youre just going to end up getting old and dying and all I could do was sit there in silence because I literally couldn't come up with anything to counter it. I fucked up and I don't know what to do.",1
"I try hard to be friendly and kind and hide my depression but nobody seems to care about me at all. I get ditched regularly and friends flake on me all the time or replace me. Anyone romantically interested in me rapidly realizes I'm boring, but I try hard to compensate by looking out for them and being nice so they will be willing to give me a chance. I really have a lot of love to give but it feels like the universe doesn't want me. It's like it's saying give up, cant you see we don't want you here? I feel like my desire to die is forced on me because I see how life could be beautiful but it's like I don't fit in it correctly. It hurts cause I'm wasting my time and everyone else's too",1
"Not sure this is the right place to post this but here it goes anyway. I have been hit hard with what I think is depression (have several symptoms) but it kind of makes me numb and not really care about shit anymore. I used to care about everything a lot and got anxious about everything, overthought everything. But now, I may not feel the best, but it's very relieving to finally lose my worries and detach from any pressure I may have had from my friends and family. Currently I don't really care enough to want to get better because I like that I finally can stop caring. Just wondering if anyone else has gone through this. Wanted to post and ask what others thought.",0

"Hello, happy new year etc, etc. Not sure if anyone will read this but I'll write anyway. I've been feeling so darn depressed for the past years and it has gotten so much worse lately. I only eat and sleep, like, all day.I have nightmares every time I try to sleep, and I wake up feeling like shit. I got so much to study and I've fallen behind. I feel so empty and no matter how much I've tried to give my life some meaning, it all feels so pointless. I'm sick of waking up, I'm sick of breathing, I'm sick of being here. I haven't been diagnosed with any kind of mental illness, basically because I avoid talking to people about how I feel. (Can't afford a therapist either). However, I don't know if a diagnosis would matter. Because I kind of feel helpless and I really feel like it doesn't even fucking matter if some prof in a coat tell me ""oh hey something is wrong with your head"". (no shit man) This feels so overwhelming, and dealing with it seems impossible. I've talked to some of the people around me, but most of them are the kind of people that like memes about mental Illnesses, so their reactions were like ""Oh I'm depressed too haha"" , or ""You have nightmares? Welcome to the club"", ""you're suicidal? Cool me too!"". Reactions by the same people who said they don't want to die because they have things they want to do.(Don't get me wrong, I love my friends) As for my family, they call my childish and say I have no reason to be depressed. Idk this post is a mess, expressing feelings is definitely not my thing. For anyone who read this far, thanks and I'm sorry.",0
"I used to have a great social life. Everyday after school and over the weekends I would hang out with friends, I even had a ""girlfriend"", and when we weren't hanging out we would text. It was one of the happiest times of my life. It was great until the next school year. Our whole friend group was separated into different classes and we all didn't hang out that much anymore outside of school. At the end of the year I found out that my 2 best friends were switching schools, one for personal reasons and one for sports reasons. When I found out I was devastated and wanted to switch schools for next year also. I looked at the school one of my friends was going to and liked it, so I switched to that school. Ever since then it seems my life is going downhill. I have a few close friends but we rarely hang out or text. I don't understand how they can handle not seeing their friends outside of school. My best friend lives in another town, so we never hang out, and my other couple friends live in the country far away from the subdivision I live in. In our classes there is also a huge gender divide, so chances are I will never have a girlfriend through high school. I spend all the time not at school on Instagram and Snapchat looking at my old friends hanging out and having a good time while I'm feeling alone. I feel like I'm missing out on what should be the best years of my life. I don't think I'll ever experience going to parties, having a girlfriend, or doing other stuff teenagers are supposed to. I feel like life is pointless right now.",0

I haven't been earning income from welfare since November so I'm really quite poor. And I just don't have any way to vent and last night, when new years plans went to hell and my license disappeared, I snapped. I broke as a person. And I tried to be okay and I couldn't be.

"2016 has possibly been one of the worst years in my life, at least emotionally-wise. Yes, I've been progressing with my exams, I even got a part-time job and started saving something, but that's all that I've been doing. Last February my GF left the country to study abroad. Little did I know, I went to visit her in April and she broke up with me 10 days later. It's been a rollercoaster of emotions since then, and all I could do to keep me sane was studying and working. I didn't pursue any personal hobbies, apart from some sporadic gaming. I've been literally preparing exams and working almost non-stop and most of the time I went to bed very late. My soul has been sucked out; If I didn't have to work anymore and I finished studying, I wouldn't know what to do apart from staying on the computer. This new year poses some early choices I have to make. I want to do my thesis and continue saving money with my job, but I don't want to be working and studying without any free time anymore. I don't know how to live anymore. I feel like I need help, but I don't want to jeopardize everything like I did with my ex by exposing my insecurities. I feel that exposing my sadness would repel everyone around me. I feel my problems are too silly. Heck, I've been putting off this post for months now and I stopped halfway my stream of conciousness because there are far more serious problems to discuss about here than some indecision, burn-out and post-breakup trauma. Half of me keeps slapping my weak and fragile other half, but I'm not making any steps forward.",0
"Hey, gunna keep this post short since I'm new to reddit and have no clue how to write. I had a car crash today. Started in far left lane ended up in far right ditch. Snow flew over car while my friend and I slid about 15 meters in 2-3 feet deep of snow. While this was happening, while my car was sliding towards the edge of the road I didn't feel any fear or anything.. I saw the oncoming ditch and just accepted the fact that there was nothing I could do. No fear. I just reacted like a robot Is this normal? People around me parents etc keep telling me I have depression because I don't show emotions at all to them. I'm starting to wonder myself.. to me it would seem normal to feel fear as I drove into a ditch at 100 kph.. but I didn't Thoughts? Dr's have told me I have depression to but I've never really believed them. Is it normal for people with depression to just be numb when things are happening? Almost like a sociopath.. no emotion just reactions",0
"I can't really remember exactly the last time I didn't want to kill myself. The feeling has always been there but I didn't really acknowledge it until about early high school. I can say with pretty good confidence that I've wanted to kill myself everyday since then. Reading many posts about what people have been through and their current awful situations just makes me feel more guilty for being suicidal even though I have a caring family and am decently well off. My birthday is on new years. I was born just past midnight, so my family and I usually celebrate it on New Year's Eve. However, the last few birthdays I haven't been happy. I always work for my parent's business because we're constantly understaffed. I don't have freedom. I just work. On top of that, I have to deal with the constant desire to just die while having to work. Every year, I'm scared of what the new year will bring, and I resent my parents just a little more for letting me become the happy little accident that I am now. Couldn't they just use a condom? 2016 has been one giant clown fiesta for me. I'm fully confident that 2017 will be just as bad. I want to make it all end now but I'm too scared of the pain and the nothingness that will consume me once I'm gone. I'm not religious so I don't believe in an after life. Often times I wish I were, that way I'd be more inclined to just get the ""pain"" part over with and to just kill myself already. There's no real order to what I'm saying. I'm just venting I guess. I wish I would just kill myself, instead.",0

"Help? I'm just feeling really shitty at how I seem to have spent the majority of my time recently lying around not doing anything, letting my room and shit get into a mess and just been consumed by negative thoughts. I'm also worse at a particular time of day. Like I've barely done anything productive this month and I hate myself for it, and I hate the fact I can't try hard enough/be bothered to help myself out of this. Some days are better than others, yes, but at the end of the day I just can't do it. I'm 17 and wasting my fucking life being lazy and doing nothing, the new year has made me realise. I want to make resolutions but I know I can't keep them so I'm not bothering. Any help/advice??",1
"I want my struggle to be over. I don't want to hurt my family or friends, but staying alive just for the sake of not hurting the people close to me doesn't make sense. I hurt them every time I am around them when I am depressed, and its constant. I can't pretend to be happy for them anymore. It's exhausting. I want to pretend it's okay around the people I care about, but I can't managed that anymore. Who do I blame? Is it my fault? I can't help but feel like I failed. I have no reason to believe that I'm worth anything. I have no source of hope.",1
"That's all. I have no value, nothing to offer anyone, and everyone knows it. If I act exceptionally nice and let people use me I can get them to spend time with me sometimes. But no one actually gives the slightest fuck about me. There's no one to share in my successes, no one who's there for me when I'm extra sad, no one who cares about what I'm thinking, no one who even enjoys my company. I'm just worthless",1
"i'm not sure if i have a depression, but i just feel really empty and and depressed for one and half years. i have no one to talk to, not only about my feelings, but just in general (for example, i spent new year's eve all alone though it is an important celebration in my country), though people my age (14) have many friends and are really sociable. it's actually the main problem why i want to see a psychologist. and i also just confused with myself. so i just don't know if it is not pointless to talk with therapist. is it really helpful? or it's just waste of time and money (i'm so bad at english, sorry, but i don't know where else i can ask for advice)",0
"but the voices, they don't stop. They tell me to kill myself every time I achieve anything and I am exhausted. I have goals and dreams, but whenever the wave comes I am reduced to nothing. I'm worried one day I'll give in.",0
"Okay everyone hello there, recently I've been having extreme panic attacks and depression. It all started with me crying imagining what would happen to me if my parents died on public transport. My mum instantly comforted me and told me that wouldn't happen (I'm 13). I continued on to yesterday which as you all know is New year's. I started getting even more panicky thinking about what happens after life and that if I die is that it? I solved that by reading some theories on after life and forming my opinion that we go into a sort of lounge with the spirits who wait for us. After that I've lost all ambition to become an entrepreneur and just thinking of what point is there to life. I've been able to get myself out of the panicky state only when watching youtube or playing video games. Any other time I end up being highly stressed for some unknown reason. Please reddit help me",0
"OK so here goes the story, please help. We¬¥ve been dating long-distance for 3 years. He used to love me to the moon and back. He¬¥s from NZ and I¬¥m from Mexico, he¬¥s 22 and I¬¥m 31. He had already broken up with me 3 months ago saying that his feelings for me were fading away but he already had a plain ticket to come see me for November. 3 days ago he broke up with me saying that he needs to be alone, that he needs to figure things out, that the distance is too hard (We were planning on me moving there in 2 years until he finished university) we already had been through 3 years together, 3 very hard years as well where my father died and I lost my mind to depression and anxiety. He says he doesn't love me anymore at least not like a partner but that he¬¥ll always love me as a friend. Could this be the depression? he says he doesn't know what he wants and that he just wants to be alone. I don't know what to do here since I was working a job that I didn't really liked but that would give me lots of job opportunities in NZ i was planning my future around him. I battled depression as well and the last thought in my mind was breaking up with him. Which is why I can¬¥t understand why he broke up with me. He says he needs all his focus on himself to get better but I didn't need that when I went through depression.",0
"I went to a club with pretty good DJs last night. I went there last year as well and enjoyed it. Last night though at first I was fine and everything was cool but it got to just after midnight and I got this overwhelming feeling that I should leave. I have been feeling low for the past couple days and just felt really anxious and upset on the day of NYE. My mood had slightly picked up before we went out but once we were there I just couldn't escape what I was feeling. My girlfriend was naturally really upset and couldn't understand why I wanted to leave. After having a bit of a row I just yelled ""It's because I'm fucking depressed!"" and left by myself. I have feelings of guilt - obviously I know she wanted me there but I let this mood I'm having control what I do. It must have looked strange to everyone and I feel like I wasted the night and an opportunity to have fun. Having said that the feeling I had making me want to leave was so overwhelming I wouldn't have enjoyed myself at all. This scares me - this hasn't happened before, I am usually a sociable person and enjoy having fun with my friends. For the past couple of weeks though I've had this feeling that I just want to stay in bed and do nothing - finally last night I acted on it. Is this depression? I really can't tell if I am or not and it worries me that this behaviour might be the start of it.",0
"2016 was probably one of the most difficult years with my depression and I think a big reason for that is because I let it. I pushed people away, not because I wanted to be alone, but because it was less exhausting than going out and doing stuff. I waited way to long to go back to my therapist and it just continued to snowball to the point that I felt there was no way out of it. I've recently taken a big step towards improving my well being and I am hoping that this will make 2017 a little more bearable. This step, being medication, has been something I've been reluctant to take as I felt like a failure. In hindsight, it's really no different than taking a medication for any other illness and in order to get better I think this is something I have to do. Cheers to a better 2017 for anyone fighting an illness.",0
"I have lost around 8 friends over the past two years. They leave without even saying goodbye. It just makes me feel so worthless because I never tried to hurt them. It's literally just my personality. I'm a ""downer"" apparently. I'm scared that I'll be alone forever. Should I change so that someone will like me?",1
"I called out of work today, and no I wasn't hung over from a night of partying. I was working until 11 last night. In the last two days I worked 30 hours, and in the next two days I'm working 21. I've been extremely depressed lately to the point where I found myself seriously considering suicide. I've been in a really bad place and haven't had the time to process any of what I've been dealing with. But I still feel really guilty and like I'm a bad employee. I'm really scared of my boss or coworkers hating me. I've never taken a day off before, and I feel like I really do need it. Plus, there are some people at my work who call out pretty often and nobody seems to care. So why am I so stressed and scared about this? Am I wrong to call out?",1
"For my whole life I think I've never felt a genuine deep connection to anybody, maybe except for my mom. That's why I never feel like I belong, even when people like me and I like them, it still doesn't feel like I'd want it to. So now I wonder if this will ever change of if I have too high expections. But then again there are a lot of peple in this world that don't feel lonely and disconnected",0
"I was sexually abused as a child, there I said it. I hate bringing it up, it's a mood killer and it's not hard to see why. The problem is, well, there are many problems. Let's just go through some of them: Extreme anxiety and depression, self doubt, little to no self confidence, the feeling that I am malingering when I am not (idk how to explain it), feeling constantly alone, forcing myself into positions where I am alone. You get the idea. I also have terrible coping mechanisms, I mostly play video games to pass the time, I am smart as my mother constantly reminds me, but all I see are my failures. I only find happiness from other people, I am always angry and sad, and this paragraph is a mess and now I'm crying.",1
"I want to die, but I love my boyfriend with all my heart. He's the only person in my life who has shown me what it is to just love someone. He's the only part of being alive that I like. My job sucks. My family sucks and without him I would have killed myself a year ago. I still don't want to live, and my functioning is going downhill fast. I want to figure out how to want this life. I want the desire to be present because it's not just me anymore, but I don't know where or how to start. How do I escape this pain?",0
"I also feel incredibly sad because I didn't realize my depression held me back so much, from everyone and everything. Most of my friends can get on with their life and do all sorts of amazing things while I'm dying inside more or less every day, rotting away at home. Fuck depression, fuck every mental illness in the world. I wish I could give you all a big hug, no one deserves to feel like a failure. And I hope 2017 will treat you better than 2016 at least... Thank you for your time.",0
"To cut the long story short, I've been depressed for 4 years nearly 5. Over the past 4 weeks, I've become a lot worse, I have anxiety, developed insomnia and I cannot eat. 3 weeks ago I tried to top myself, for the second time in nearly 5 years. I ended up in a A&amp;E and now I'm an outpatient at the loony hospital. I have booked a trip to Amsterdam for the 5th alone, if I can't find happiness within myself while I am there I think this is truly it for me. The monsters aren't living under my bed they're inside my head, I'm going insane. Please help.",0
"This last year, I decided to get help for what I thought was depression. Turns out it was. I opened myself up to somebody for the first time in years and ended up getting my heart broken amongst one of the worst depressed periods in my life. It's been a lot of picking myself up, so much so where I think I'd rather just lay on the ground forever at times but I'm hoping this year doesn't fucking beat me when I'm down like 2016 did. Anyway, rant type thing over.",0
Spent new years alone (see my other post for details) when it hit 1AM and I knew no one was going to talk to me that night or wish me well I wrote my note and tried suicide drank a lot then when I was good and drunk I cut a lot and passed out turns out I was too drunk to go deep enough but I've come into work wishing I hadn't woken up i cant even fake a smile I'm so angry I failed no one at work has seemed to notice I'm upset so looks like no one cares about me after all,0
"So my new years resolution is to focus on my depression but I feel if I fail to improve it I will just get worse due to the feeling of futility that will follow so can anyone recommend anything on top of this list: Frequent meals with protein and fats such as olive oil and omega 3 Exercise every day not too light or heavy Meditation daily, different types Vitamin D and perhaps some other supplements such as omega 3 pushing myself more and thinking less, so focusing on current task and not how I feel.",0
"i have liked her for so long.. once i confessed to her and i got rejected. even so, i still harboured feelings towards her. but then today came around and i saw her whatsapp status: 'I love ___"" . this may be really childish compared to whats on this reddit thread, but i just wanted to let go of how i honestly feel. It hurts me, it really does. who would have thought being a human would be this painful....",0
"There's nothing ""happy"" in my new year. It's been the same for 10 fucking years: my parents get drunk, they start fighting and later they start bothering me and my big brother. It isn't fucking fair. This happens every goddamn holiday. Christmas, New Years Eve, birthdays, every fucking holiday... but I hope someone else had a much better New Years Eve...",0
"I seriously need to vent and would appreciate your opinions The last months have been pretty rough, but I've been trying to keep it together. I'm always the one who asks if you're okay, if I could help. I'm the one you can depend on, always. My phone's always on vibration, so I can be there for the people around me. I really try my best to give as much love to this world as I can, but it's tearing me apart. It feels like nobody really cares about me and my feelings. Nobody's really interested in me for the person I am. We live in a cold, heartless world and it feels like they're only interested in me, because I'm giving them the security and love they can't get elsewhere. I'm there for them in their darkest hours, but as soon as the sky clears up, they don't need me any longer. I'm currently isolating myself from others and from myself/my feelings. Does anyone else feel like this as well? What do you do about it?",0
"my grades are so bad. i am the only one who failed out of the grade in my class and now im all alone in a new class full of failures like me and i really dont know what to do. it feels like all my friends from my previous class are just subtly looking down on me, and i hate it. Fuck the education system and fuck myself for not being able to pass.",1
"A close (at least I thought she was close to me) friend lied to me that she doesn't celebrate New Year and doesn't go anywhere, but she was in a cafe last night. By the way I heard from a friend that she saw her there with another friend drunk af. So, what should I do? She was my only female friend (I'm male by the way) and I really thought we are getting in a real friendship. I don't want to tell her for now, but what do you suggest I do? EDIT: Well, at least now I have a reason to hate someone else instead of hating and blaming myself all the time.",0
Causing the only people who care about me to be driven away only making me more depressed. I just want it all to end and feel happy once more so badly,0
"All of my life I've struggled to fit in, which coupled with lots of stress and anxiety drove me to depression. I was incredibly lonely, spending my days sleeping and staring into a screen. This year gave me hope though, I met the most amazing girl imaginable - intelligent, funny, sweet/kind, romantic, sexy, same interests, everything I've ever wanted. She was the first girl I've ever dated, someone who actually saw me as something other than the ugly, awkward guy. I actually planned to kill myself around that time, but it all went away after that. I was the happiest guy in the world. That all changed though after she suddenly attempted suicide a few weeks ago. Now all she does is push me away when I try to be there for her (going as far as to dump me) and refuses to see anything beside the negative no matter how much I try to reassure her. She's like an entirely different person now, definitely not the same girl that told me she loved me every night. Meanwhile, I'm even worse than I was before. It's already enough that depression ruined *my* life, but now it's destroying the person dearest to me and there's nothing I can do to stop it. Fuck everything.",0
"I'm not visiting a therapist for 10 years and have to take heave medication everyday. I haven't been in a war and had a friend die in my arms. I'm not a homeless, heavy drug addict. It's like today everyone is depressed. I don't want anyone to believe that i'm just some person trying to get attention or be a stereotype. For me life is hell but i know that there is a person that has it worse. But for me my problems are obviously the worst thing but... I dunno. I'm not worth that. A lot of shit happened to me, many stuff i don't even know exactly anymore because all i did my whole life is try to suppress it all to the point that i have no idea who i am anymore. I now i'm not normal but at the same time i feel like i'm not ""worth"" being called depressed or something. I'm just stuck between life and time with no where to turn to and not a goddamn clue what i am or what i'm allowed to be. There is no end and i can't even tell where i belong to. It's like i'm stuck in a tiny, tiny hole and i can barely breath. Can't even type this without thinking to myself ""Just get over it, you're just stupid and not entitled to this. Just stop."" I hate everything.",1
"I don't enjoy the ""nice"" things other people seem to enjoy. Whenever I hear people treating themselves to nice things - a nice meal, a nice drink, a nice bubble bath, a nice warm bed, a nice movie, a nice fuzzy or otherwise comfortable garment, a nice place to be or visit - all I can think to myself is ""How miserable it must be to enjoy those things alone. I could do any one of those things right now, but it wouldn't make me feel better. It would make me feel worse for trying to 'take care of' myself like I'm some wounded baby that needs nursing."" Especially reading a book. Dear God, I could never distract myself from the disconnect I feel inside of me to enjoy reading a book Why don't I get that little rush of dopamine from behavior others find rewarding?",0
"I've been feeling terrible and didn't want to talk, but I've been ignoring her calls for almost the whole month, so I had to let her know I'm alive. I'm not suicidal, I just can't handle the stress of her always asking about my plans. I lied through my teeth that I'm completely fine and my application for graduate school is all finished. The truth is, I dropped the application after not being able to finish the personal statement/essay. I have no idea what I'm doing or what I'll be doing, or how I can stay in the US if I don't continue my studies (I'm on a student visa). I just don't want to go home. I feel even more terrible now.",0
"Hi, I'm extremely sorry if this isn't allowed but I have gone through depression all my life and this is honestly just a breaking point for me. I'm a 19 year old female going through a really hard 1 sided breakup. We were together for more than a year, I miss him more than you could ever imagine and my emotions are all over the place.. He stole around 300$ from me right before he left and has done so many horrible things but I can't help but love him. I made a few mistakes after he did and he said this was the reason. He wanted to have a friends with benefits relationship right afterwards.. I almost fell for it because I wanted him. I felt empty before and I just feel completely numb and empty now, I don't have 1 second of happiness anymore and I just don't want to live through it. The pain is so fucking BAD. I miss how he made me feel, physically and mentally. I take medication for depression, see a therapist, and have extreme social anxiety. He helped me so much and I have nothing to hold onto anymore. I'm seriously broken. I guess I just want to talk to someone who is going through the same thing so we can go through it together? I don't even know what I'm saying. I don't have many friends I just really.. . really need someone right now. Thanks for reading.",0
"Wtf is wrong with the world ? people killing others for no reasons, people thinking money is worth more than a human life. The wolrd we live in is so depressing. I'm depressed since i'm 16 (now 19) and i'm not doing better. I take pills and i consult a psychologist but it doesn't work. I don't like doing a lot of things, when i start a new project i either fail or i lose my interest after a couple of weeks and i just give up. I don't go to school because i suck at it and i'm unemployed because i hate every job i do and it makes me even more depressed. I cry almost every night for no reason and it's very hard for me to sleep because my head is always full of shit. I'm too tired to do something but not enough to fall asleep. Basically, i'm just sitting at home doing nothing. Let me tell you, it's fucking boring ! I don't really know what to do to get better, at least i have friends and family that care about me and support me through this, they are the reason why i'm still here today. I just wanted to know if anyone is going through the same shit as I am. No one really understand how i'm felling and it's sad because they want to help but they can't ... i feel like nobody can help me. I'm here, in my bedroom, waiting for my body to die of sadness. I feel empty because my soul died a long time ago.",0
"I've had help from the nhs as a teenager for my mental health, specifically with anxiety in the past but I think it just made these issues worse due to the medications and the general misunderstanding I recieved from doctors. Im 18 now and feel like I need to do something because I want to die and have been depressed for almost a decade and can't see any way of things getting better. Its just terrifying because I dont think I can cope with all the drama involved in trying to get help in this country, and its only supposed to be worse as an adult. I'm really sorry cause I know its so much harder for some people in other countries. I don't really know why I'm posting, I just don't know who to talk to. I just feel really on my own and don't know what to do.",0
"Title says it all. I feel completely alone, but I'm physically not. My husband just doesn't get it and I'm starting to think I've made a mistake. He says I always do this around milestones. I want to punch him in the face and tell him to get the fuck away from me. I just want to lay in my bed and have the next several days just disappear until I have to go back to work. I hate myself like this, but I also hate how completely alone I feel.",1
"I care strongly about the truth. I don't care how depressing and unwanted it is. People get very emotional when I talk about subjects and I can't seem to explain to them that the concepts have nothing related to them, it's all about the idea. I need someone to relate to",0
"Maybe because all I feel like I am is a toy. A useless one, at that. I wonder how he puts up with me. Use and throw away. Stupid. Boring. Unattractive. Terrible in bed. All I'm good for is for getting other people off and not myself. For spoiling others, because I don't want the burden of possessions for when I finally off myself. I had a nice thought earlier. Sell off all my things. Work up a travel fund. Travel to a nice place to disappear and die, probably. Somewhere that hopefully nobody I know has to deal with it. There's some things up in the air leaving me feeling uncertain, even though I was told they would help me. But I can't help but feel gross, or a burden for asking for financial assistance. I never wanted people to spend money on me. I can't wait until I can go back to living alone, where I don't have to eat. I am so sick of existing. I don't even really have much of a sex drive anymore. My libido's gone straight through the floor. I still crave being touched, but at the same time I feel like it would instigate a fight if he tried. Love him to death, but I can't shake that feeling that he only stays because I'm a clingy piece of shit.",1
"So yesterday, I asked all of my friends if they had plans for the New Years Eve as I had nothing to do. They all told me that they were not going to do anything and just gonna chill out with their family. So I thought, alright since all my friends aren't going out then I might as well just stay home with my family too. Shortly after the midnight countdown, I checked my snapchat, and what did I see? All my friends were partying it up and having fun without me! I was so fucking pissed off and sad. This wasn't the first time they did this and this was the last fucking straw, I am never gonna talk to them ever again. But now I have no friends at all, how can one recover from this and make new friends? I need some advice please.",0
"I don't feel good. I am in a really bad place in my head. my hands are shaking because I just had a heated argument with my ex ""friend"". I really want to fucking kill him an the others. I wasted my time with them and they just think they can throw me away like a fucking tissue. I don't know what to do. The others don't look at me or communicate with me , maybe because I remind them of what they did. I really want to fucking batter their skulls in with a heavy rock.",0

"It feels like a vicious cycle. Im not allowed to leave my room until my HW's done (with the exception of eating meals). And because I cant focus, I don't get my work done. So I stay in my room like 80% of the time. The inablity to do anything stresses me out and makes me depressed. And because Im depressed, I cant focus on my work. So the work just piles up and up while I sit in my room, unable to get anything done. I try and try to get my work done, and I know I can do it, *but it just doesnt happen*. It makes me feel like a big screwup compared to my sister, who when she was my age, almost always got grades above a B. I need to brake the cycle, but I dont know where. Ive tried taking medicine to help me focus, but it doesnt seem to work. My semester ends in 2 weeks and I dont know what to do.",0
I don't know how I should place it but it seems like everyone of my friends have that one they can go to And every time I think I have found that one in my life they always stop answering completely and i don't know why or they just change and they will be complete asshole too me and I'm just tired of it I'm tired of not having anyone in my life I have been battling depression for about 3 years now and there is nobody there is nobody that has comed so close to be that I have told them and they didn't left after and I just think my life is just a pass time no meaning,0
"It just blows my mind. Are there really people out there that wake up, don't continue to lay in bed, and just start doing things? I dunno how they do it. I don't get how someone could enjoy whatever their hobbies are, and enjoy them without ever stopping due to how pointless it is, or how pointless all of life is. I can't imagine what it's like to have a family that loves you, or to be an important person to anyone else. Some people can get so much out of life with minimal effort, and all I can really do is lay in bed and cry about how nothing makes me feel good, how I can't enjoy anything, and how incredibly lonely and alien I feel. Classic question: Why me?",0
"I don't have my own work space so I have to do all my work and gaming in the common room with everyone. I don't have a job or friends that I can call and go places with, and I can't afford to move out anytime soon. My parents still act like I'm 15 years old and if I ever want to go somewhere they have to know where, with who, and for how long. So there goes any hope of dating, because I'm not one to talk about that stuff with my parents, and if they found out I was dating someone they *would* force me to answer questions I don't want to discuss with them. And then there's the constant fighting over literally everything. I'm walking on eggshells to avoid triggering my mother, and everyone knows it but nobody will talk about it. I know she raised me and all but she acts batshit sometimes. It almost feels like I'm the stereotypical unhappy 40 year old who wants to go out and have fun but has kids and bills, and I'm only 18 in college.",0
"I suffer from depression in the form of mental exhaustion and lack of energy. I also get very anxious and have mild OCD. My anxiety has reduced greatly, sometimes I fixate on and worry about things but it's not constant like before. My OCD has lessened, but it's still there sadly. My depression has not lifted, I seem to have a bit more physical energy and motivation but I am still mentally clouded. It's hard to tell if any achievements over this period were due to the meds or my own efforts. SIDE EFFECTS: Lowered sex drive, lowered appetite. If it doesn't work soon I will either give up meds or ask to try Mirtazapine.",0
"The depression is back again with a vengeance this time. I have been having health issues with no success of them being fixed after seeing multiple doctors. My friends know I haven't been well and yet don't really seem to care to reach out to me in the last 3 months. I spend half my time crying because I want to just die. I don't want to commit suicide because I will be forever known as selfish. At least if a car hit and killed me I could escape from all of this and not have any guilt about leaving my family. My boyfriend can't handle it anymore and is leaving me. He left me alone NYE as I went to the emergency room for excruciating pain. He decided to go to a party and get hammered. He didn't once ask me how I was. I can't afford anymore therapy, my insurance is garbage and doesn't pay enough. I guess I have to be a zombie on medications now. Thanks for reading this rant.

"I guess I'll start off by saying that I've been dealing with depression about eight years. It has peaked in the past, but I'd say I've been mostly positive since then. About one or two days out of every month it hits me with reminders that it's still there. Today is one of those days. I woke up next to my girlfriend (who I absolutely love) and I just feel like I'm always worrying about doing/saying the right thing. When something bothers me, I tell her. No matter how small it may seem. It just helps me get things off my chest and out of my mind. She hates when I do this, because she thinks I'm trying to pick a fight, and argue over something so meaningless. She tells me if roles were reversed, these things wouldn't bother her. So how do I even deal with these thoughts? I can't just hold them back, because then it's obvious something is on my mind. I can't just push it out of my mind by rationalizing it, because I'm constantly worrying. I also feel like there are so many guys that would love to have her. I think if I fuck up and constantly bug her about things, that she'll be closer to the door. I guess I'm just feeling shitty today and I wish I could just change it. Hope all of you are trying to stay positive as well.",0
"I'm very lonely lately, I'd like to find someone who can feel like I do and help me through it all. I'd like to exchange private messages, as there's no real life people I can really turn to with my problem. So feel free to pm me, I appreciate all help.",0
"Many of us know that spending your days and nights away on the computer keeps you from thinking of doing anything stupid, at least that's how it is for me. Without this thing, it's nothing but me and my thoughts. Maybe I just have some sort of addiction, but when I'm off of it for even 5 minutes to go to the bathroom or something, I'm reminded of how shitty life is. I'm reminded of the shit I'll have to do in a few months, since I'm about to graduate (only had 2 classes for grade 12). I still don't have any ideas on what I want to do for my life, and it still is a looming thought over my head that what I pick I'll be stuck with until I retire. I know, you don't have to stick with it, but still. Having to work your life away, what's the point. But yeah, the computer is my life and without it I'm truly broken. When I'm not on it I just want to fucking die, even sometimes when I'm on it like right now I just want to drop what I'm doing, and just lie down on the floor. I just want to give up. There's not really a point in anything anymore.",0
"i have had a rough 2016, i have had a lot of problems at home and at college. life is feeling really heavy and i question the purpose of my life too often for a 20 year old. i don't have the feeling that i have enough friends who care or real friends at all. life for me is just a day to day battle with myself. i really need someone who wants to talk about me and them. i have been seeing a therapist for a half year but quit because of a feeling of insufficient help. also i have been taking medication (serlain) but i don't take anymore, should restart though.",0
"Just read an article saying that the president-elect will undo many executive orders his first day in office. I'm positive this will include DACA, which means I will lose my work permit. Just thinking about having to go back to my birth country is stressing me out so much. I don't want to leave my home, the U.S. This announcement and so many things that have happened in my life just seem like signs that I don't belong in this life. I've been holding onto a bit of hope for the past 7 years, but I see that things just get worse. I wasn't sure if I would make it to 2017, but now I'm 99.9% sure I won't make it to 2018.",0
"My depression feels like an overwhelming heavy-ness depleting the motivation, confidence and happiness of my former self. I know all of the ways to fight depression by eating, sleeping, drinking water, meditating well. But majority of the time I can't get myself to do any of those. Smoking pot gets my thoughts racing now on how I continue to fuck up. Continue doing what I Know makes me unhappy. I can't explain it in person. My work is being effected my health is being effected. Idk what to do. Idk who I am. I feel worthless. I feel disconnected. It's like a nightmare clenching onto my dreams. They're screaming to be seen while being taken over by shadows. I have so many plans I must see through but I can't and it fucking sucks. I'm sorry if this isn't appropriate Idk how reddit works I'm just really going downhill and needed to at least write.",1
"I've been depressed since I was 18 and I'm 26 today. If I could point at something that's causing my depression, I would say that it's my lack of physical contact with other humans. I feel so lonely, and it keeps getting worse the older I get. Treatment hasn't helped. So if I were to test, if this is infact what is causing it, how could I go about it? In my dreamworld I would have 30min sessions, a couple of times a week where I snuggle to tv-series with a girl. But of course this is impossible to do. What came first the chicken or the egg? Maybe I'm just thinking too much about my depression, it could be very well be that my depression came first which is why it's impossible for me to find a partner. Has anyone had several years of no human contact, and then found a bf/gf only to have the depression continue uninterrupted?",0
"I feel nothing. I have been feeling like this for a long time. Sometimes I feel happy, sometimes I feel sad, but for the most part I don't feel anything at all. I think the last time I cried was probably 10 years ago. Two days ago I was watching Bojack Horseman, and one of the episodes hit me for some reason. It was in season two, when Bojack started crying outside the library. Something clicked with me and I started crying too. I was crying for 10, 20, 30 minutes. I just sat there and cried. In silence, alone. I don't know why, but after I stopped, I was happy. I don't think I've ever been so happy before. Sadly, this whole thing lasted only for a brief moment and before long I was back to the cycle of emptiness. Since then I've been trying to find something to get me into that state again, but nothing even comes close. Sad songs. Rick and Morty. People talking about their life. Nothing. I just sit there and there is nothing coming out of me at all, like an empty bowl. I don't know if ever I will experience that feeling again. I hope I will. I don't know why I'm typing this.",0
"So, in the past year i've had 3 jobs. In the beginning of 2016, i worked 2 jobs and ended up just not showing up at both due to some personal reasons with my ex around May/June. I didn't get another job until September. So here i am, only working there a few months, and this is the second time i've done a no call no show within 3 weeks. I can't get myself to get out of bed. I just turned 19. I had to have my mom call off for me the other day because i was having a mental breakdown. The jobs i have are not even stressful, but i'm so terrified to actually CALL and talk to a manager and tell them i can't come in, and it's not like being depressed is a work excuse. I go to school full time as well. I technically don't HAVE to work, but i feel useless if i don't. I guess the point of this post is, does anyone have any advice on how to keep a job with depression? Or have any recommendations on jobs? I take medication, so there's nothing else to really help. I'm actually a really hard worker when i don't hit my lows, which is like every few weeks..",0
"I want to help my papa, who suffers from obvious depression. He had a pretty tough life: loosing his mother when he was young, my grandfather made him drop out of high school to start working and earn money to leave in the house. He worked from 16 to 45 years. He had a meaningful job where he met my mom, who left the company a few weeks after starting dating him. At some point he was ""promoted"" but not really, and left the job shortly after. Long story short: he popped from job to job until 45 yo, and have been unemployed since. My mom works and earn enough money to feed us (although some months this becomes an issue), but her job takes her away from the family for like 2 weeks straight sometimes, which obviously she hates. At 55, and unemployed for 10 years, my dad feels depressed and guilty for not being able to give my family a better life. He tries really hard to look like he is ok, but he is depressed like noone I've ever seen. I can't do much by myself since im in college and haven't found a job yet. My brother has, but he prefers to take his SO in vacations. This subreddit has helped me in the past, so please give me opinions on how can I help a truly good man who has had bad luck in life.",0
"After many years of variety of meds for a variety of things (ADHD, depression, sleep, bipolar), I decided to self-medicate with coffee, melatonin, excercise, a therapy light, and running my own business rather than having to follow stupid rules. Actually, the self-medication thing worked pretty well. It probably helps that I've lived with a physician for many years. However, the business did not go well, and I'm back to being full-time employed for someone else. Basically, I'd need to make an appointment in St. Paul before work or after work, but I'd prefer weekends. I know this is not a TwinCities specific board, but with 160k readers, I figure there might be someone from around here.",0
"It's so difficult when someone asks me what my hobbies/interests are. I can't just say 'staying home and sleeping all the time' or 'watching hours of YouTube' or something. I wish I could say I still have hobbies but I just don't. Sometimes I like to say 'I like going out to eat' but that's a lie because I try my hardest not to. I've always been the kind of person to just put on a front around other people and laugh and try to say what a normal person would say. I hate that I'm doing nothing with my life, but it's difficult to be determined when emotionally you just don't have the will to. Do you feel the same? What motivates you to change?",1
"The start of a new year is supposed to represent a new beginning, right? A reset button on life? Well, wasn't it great when I realized I would be welcoming it with a wonderful little episode of depression! I think it was my first episode in a month or so.

It doesn't help that I'm 19 and have basically zero dating experience. Why am I even trying?",0
"I have no happiness in my life at all, I try and distance myself emotionally from my family because it's easier that way than feeling guilt and them not understanding.

"Never diagnosed but suspect depression. Making new year's resolutions and top of the list was the same one as last year: do something about my mental health... But then it struck me I'm not really that bad. Basically, felt shitty off and on and have some good days (more bad than good) for the last year. I don't really care about most things any more, but I think I'm just lazy, and my sleep cycle is fucked up (however I feel like it always has been). I'm know I should do something but I haven't got the energy and I'm too lazy. I keep telling myself I'm just a lazy shit but then why haven't I done something. When I'm distracted I'm usually fine?! Like I'm not as bad as others, and half the online tests say I don't have a problem, so I feel like I'm constantly trying to justify to myself that I do have a problem, rather than living my life.

Girl I really like decided that she didn't want a relationship and told me today.

Some way or another I got to pull myself out of this pit I'm in I'm probably the lowest I've ever been now and I need to get back up to where I was before I felt like this.

I am pretty sure she has a boyfriend. But even if she never had a boyfriend going into relation would still be impossible. She won't agree to go into relation.

"When I was around 10 my mom was babysitting kids and we went outside to play. When we were playing we ended up using the hose and for some odd reason I told my friend to hold the hose so it wouldn't squirt water and I put my face over it and he let go and i angrily threw a plastic play toy at him ( a light toy ). My mom became instantly angry. She started saying come here in a angry voice and I ran across the yard. Surprisingly she didn't come get me. Long story short I ran in the house went under the couch and hid. My mom rang the phone to my dad and he answered my mom whose was screaming because she couldn't find me. She found me and grabbed me and I kept yelling ""god please help."" And she put her knees on my arm and grabbed a pillow and put it over my face. But then she let go and told me to go down stairs. She told me how much I was a mistake and how she hated me and doesn't love me. I still remember that day like it was yesterday. I tried killing myself 3times this month because I think about it everyday. I don't know what to do because it emotionally scared me. Can some one please help me.",0
"Life is a race. A race that spans over many years. One that's hard, challenging and ultimately extreme. But I'm not an athlete. Forced to compete in a race I've never decided to enter. Your legs slowly dragging accross the hard concrete. Your feet hurt. The soles of your shoes are slowly mending with you. Every grain in the road, every little rock scarring you. Every step you take adding more and more baggage. Life's a race. My spirit, feet and body ache. They're longing for that rest, that refreshment. But everytime you get to the booth of refreshments, someone takes it away. You try to run, but you just need a break. Sometimes it's okay to give up. Life is a race, one I didn't choose to start. But one I choose to end. I need a break. A permanent break.",0
"Hi all, A friend of mine has gone down a depression spiral over the past year and 1/2. She has seen psychologists and psychiatrists and the only thing they seem to help with is medication. She has refused to take the medication properly. She started but stopped after feeling terrible. She will make plans and then cancel them because of her panic attacks. They happen daily at specific times, she has one at 7am daily. They will also occur intermittently throughout the day and which point she will be unable to do anything but runaway and be alone, presumably. She cannot work, remember things consistently, or think. She has attempted to jump out of a moving vehicle. Friends and family have all come to her aid but she essentially refuses any kind of answer because they do not solve her issues. I'm not sure there is a correct answer. The biggest source of sadness for her is her age, coupled with where she is in life. She has spent the past 4 years in a masters program for biology that most likely will not amount to a job. She feels as if she wasted her time and will have nothing to show for it. I have suggested changing fields but she doesn't have the financial resources to do so comfortably. She is also engaged and doesnt not feel comfortable relying on her fiance for money. She doesn't make a lot of money, so paying for therapy isn't an option, really. I'm just a friend, but I feel helpless that I cannot help her. She has attempted to hurt herself, so I want to do whatever I can or at least be helpful in some way. Any suggestions would be helpful.",0
"Just curious, as last year I have lost most if not all of my friends and in the New Year even my sibling has told me ""I don't want to be around negative people"" and proceeded to cut me out in all social platforms and in real life.

"I've been fat all my life. Have been depressed for a year and a half now. When I wake up, sometimes I literally can't move my legs, because the bottom part of my spine hurts SO MUCH. I've been on a diet 2 years ago, lost 33Kg of the 60 Kg I had to lose, the pain went away for some time, but I just gave up on the diet for several reasons and the pain returned. Anyway, just wanted to share my situation :/ When I manage to get a small victory against depression and ""wake up"", I still have to fight against the pain that doesn't let me move without moaning. If I try to get up, the bottom of my spine hurts, if I manage to stand up, my legs feel like 2 sharp spikes stinging my waist, and every step feels like a marathon :/.

"I suspect that what I'm dealing with is a mixture of anxiety and depression, but I haven't been to talk to anyone yet. I'm a college student and plan to see one of the psychologists on-campus after they reopen for spring semester. Anyway, I've been dealing with a lot of issues of feeling alone, sad, and generally hating myself. Not all the time...but enough for it to be an issue. I only talk to my boyfriend because he's the only one I trust. I have one friend but we aren't close enough to discuss ""real"" issues. My anxiety stems from having a chronic illness and being sexually abused in a past relationship, on top of a lot of general social anxiety. A lot of my ""depression"" (I say that in quotes because I'm not sure if that's what it is yet) is self-defeating. I frequently find my mind telling me that I'm worthless, even though I logically know it isn't true. There have even been times when I'm home alone and force myself to go somewhere because 1)I'm too miserable in my own head and 2)I'm afraid I'll succomb to hurting (NOT killing) myself if I'm alone with my own thoughts. I've just been struggling a lot lately and wondered if anyone has similar experiences and has gotten through it. I am going to see someone, and I'm contemplating Zoloft. Not as a real fix, but just something to help me dig out of this hole I'm in right now. Sorry this was so long, just a lot of thoughts to shuffle through!",1
"Am I better? Not really, as a whole. I'm on a new cocktail of meds that keep me stable for 9 hours of the day and let me sleep at night. I'm still very depressed, i just have healthier ways of coping. At least my anxiety is better than it was, so that's good. But I don't know, it's like my attempt didn't happen, I feel the same, just not really wanting to try it again because good god I'm going through a hell of a bureaucratic process because of it. And the psych ward was terrifying. I know getting better is a slow process but I've lost my patience over the years. Last night I was at a new years party with my best friends but I had to leave at 930 because the depression got too big and I didn't want to be a party pooper. It sucks I cant make plans later in the day cause that's when the morning meds wear off and my nighttime ones don't do the same stuff. I hate this damn disease. Sorry for rambling, writing helps me some.",0
"So, I've been trying to work on a research paper since October, and everything I came up with, my professor turned down. Around the end of November, right before Thanksgiving, my professor gave me a topic and a list of books. I took it because what other choice did I have? My professor knows I work two jobs, commute an hour to school everyday and an hour home, and suffer from bipolar disorder, depression, and anxiety. On top of this, I was taking four other classes that were just as demanding. Here I am now, sitting at my desk, looking at this pile of books, and I'm starting to physically hit myself with them from stress and anxiety. I have no idea what to do. Part of me wants to take this ""F"" on the class and drop out, but another part of me knows how horrible that would be and how much disappointment I'll be filled with, not to mention my family. I just am completely miserable and lost.",1

I told her to go away, but, she wouldn't listen. I eventually picked her up and threw her across the table. Then I knocked one of the bouncers out. 5 more of them came, tackled, and beat me to shreds. I had to spend my New Years in jail.

I tell people no to hanging out constantly because I can't get out of bed, I work as much overtime as possible to avoid real interaction and I mask it with determination but as soon as friends do something without inviting me I'm heartbroken. I've always suffered from mild depression but I was alright until about 5 years ago bulimia snuck in. Right before my eyes it creeped into a crippling depression, but I can't even place when it got this bad. I get happy for moments and my mind quickly tells me it won't last and puts me back in my place I don't feel like anyone close to me fully understands. Yesterday I went to a party with close friends and hardly spoke to anyone. To make matters worse, a guy I used to talk to that was flirting with a good friend of mine and now I'm anxious that they think that's why I was upset when really my depression just felt like it was a good time to kick in. Which brings me to my severe social anxiety.......long spiraling story short I've only gotten out of bed once today to make a sandwich, ate said sandwich in bed and went back to sleep.

My doctor has me on meds but nothing seems to work I know for a fact ,obviously, that if I don't die before my parents or other family members do I'm going to be alive for the death of them. It's just a really scary thought I know I'm lucky to stil lhavd my parents as some people lost one or both of them. I just don't know what I'm going to do without them. Even as am adult I would be so distraught and lost in life without them. It's killing me It's something everyone goes through so I hate to feel so shitty about something that will happen regardless I try to make the most of every second im with them but when I'm with them I can't help but thinking the same thing- they'll be gone one day. It feels impossible to think anything positive and it sucks. I don't know how to stop thinking so negative but I pray and wish every day that these negative thoughts would stop flooding my mind so I can actually enjoy time spent with them because they could be gone anytime and I'd regret feeling so sad around them",0
I swore 2016 wouldn't be another 2015 and then it all fell apart. I got incredibly depressed around March and suffered a breakdown and dropped out of school. I haven't finished a semester of college since December 2013 even though I've enrolled in classes several times since. I had a couple opportunities to get a job but in my usual fashion I totally blew it (caught the flu when I was supposed to go in for an interview). I'm 21 and am doing nothing with my life. I know I'm young but at this rate I'll just be living with my mom until I die. I don't know how to fix this. This is the worst. My health has deteriorated as well. I've gained about 50 pounds and have a poor diet in general. I always feel like shit. I know the solution is to just stop eating so much but it's hard when food is the only thing that makes you feel good.,0

I like going out alone if I go out, she always wants to go out with her other friends and such. That's fine. But where are they when she needs someone? I can't be constantly reassuring her that everything will be fine and agreeing with her so she doesn't flip, when I'm sitting there thinking about ways to hurt myself when I get home or if I can slip off to the bathroom and find something to hold me over.

Last night he said that he thinks I'm not comfortable around him anymore, when the reality is that I'm really uncomfortable with myself and am always self-conscious about it.

She finally got around to having us exchange divorce paperwork a few months back, and on Jan 12 we'll be having a quick trial for a no-fault divorce. This was never a separation I wanted. I went from marriage counseling directly to weekly individual therapy last year, though I had found it unhelpful and stopped going after a few months. I feel like I annoy my friends when I try to talk to them about this, and there's always stuff going on in the back of my mind about this. I just want out of this mess, but I know in two weeks that even though there may be some legal closure, emotionally I'm not optimistic that things will be final. As a 28 year old guy, I hate that so much time has past and I still feel stuck and like shit. How do I get through this?",0
"People are luckier than me. People are more social than me. People live more spendy lives than me. How and why?? I have a co-worker who makes the same that I do. He has a girlfriend, his own place, motorcycles, a truck, takes his girlfriend to dinners. All on the same pay rate as me. I barely get by with rent to my parents, food, and miscellaneous things that I need to live. How the fuck does he do that? Someone I know had a nice car. Sold it for a good chunk of change, and turned around and bought it back a few months later for cheap as fuck. How the fuck does he do that? How does he find stupid suckers to sell a car to that'll turn around and give it back to him for cheap. Essentially just giving him fucking money? I'm poor, I'm lonely, I'm broke despite living with my parents. What the fuck am I doing wrong. My college degree hasn't done shit for me other than get me 25k in debt with piling interest.",1
"Ive been on Viibryd for about a year give or take. The first few months I gained about 20lbs and all together ive gained 25lbs( last I knew.) I stopped weighing myself about 2 months ago because it was getting even more depressing. I've read a few forums and have noticed that most people have experienced rapid weight gain with this medication, and no matter how hard they've worked- the weight wont budge. same issue here. I'm ready to ditch this medication because 1. I'm sick of dealing with the weight gain, going to the gym 3-6 times a week has done nothing. 2. it seems to increase my anxiety at times. 3.Its expensive(even with a coupon code and insurance.) The thing is- I'm VERY scared as I know that depression can become harder to treat over time. I tried probably about 8 medications before I found this one- I really thought there was no hope beforehand. I've stuck it out because obviously mental health is more important that weight gain, but the weight gain is causing me to obsess over what I eat/how often I workout. Does anyone currently take viibryd? Have you even come off of it, what was it like? I heard the withdrawals are horrible.",0
"So like many of us, I've suffered from anxiety and depression for my entire adult life. Pretty severe depression to be honest. About 5 years ago I started taking Celexa under my general practitioners recommendation , and it was incredible. It made a huge difference in every way possible and it was like I was a new person. Eventually I (stupidly) weaned off it, thinking I was ""cured"" and went for about 2 ish years not on any meds. Eventually I predictably fell back into my depression. Went back to the doctor. We tried celexa again- didn't work. wasn't anything like the first time. then put me on wellbutrin- didn't really work either. then we finally tried effexor- same deal, didn't notice any positive changes. I don't exactly remember but I believe we also tried upping the dosages of these meds also. i'm getting increasingly frustrated and unsure of what to do. i've been struggling finding the right meds now for years. I would give anything to go back to that ""clear, happy"" feeling I got from my first batch of celexa. but i've not been able to find it. does anyone have any thoughts or suggestions for me? what is the next step? any other meds that I might recommend to my doctor to try next?",0
"For the sake of brevity, I will not go into too many details here, but here are the basics. Over the past few years, my mother's mental health has deteriorated drastically to the point of suicidal. It is now at the lowest point and she has tried multiple times to commit suicide. She had health insurance for when she had her double mastectomy early in 2016 but my father quit paying for it. If she had health insurance, the doctor said she would have been put straight into inpatient care but instead she was urged to go to outpatient. This is just not a possibility with her at this moment. There is no way she is capable of going to get help herself and I do not know what else I can do. I do not have much money as I am currently a college student. I do not know exactly what are my options to try and get her some help and it has been difficult finding the right path to get her some help. If anyone knows of a way to get some low cost options or even just a general direction for me to look, it would be much appreciated. I am really struggling here because I can not give her the full time care she needs to get better. Thank you for listening and have a Happy New Year.",0
"Over the past year I've lost the majority of my friends. It started off with a health issue that I obviously couldn't prevent, which somehow made me lose most of my friends in high school. I then thought I was alright as I still had a couple of very close friends. I was outgoing, and some other people still seemed to like me. But almost immediately after graduation everyone stopped talking to me. And now in college I still feel so upset and bitter about my high school experience that I don't know how to open up to new people. I'm quiet, introverted, and can't connect with the people I meet. I've met a ton of seemingly great people that right after meeting me escaped becoming my friend. So now I'm lonely in college, my depression is creeping back up after years of carefree happiness, and I've taken to the Internet and video games as my safe place. It's a life that's depressing, but I hope that one day I'll stop feeling so numb and alone. One of my closest friends recently just stopped talking to me. We used to play xbox all the time together. Now she hardly answers my texts, giving the simple ""busy"" excuse. I've spent too much time trying to be supportive and loving when other people won't give me a minute of their own time. This is only one example of why I've become only a ghost of my typical self. I guess, has anyone ever dealt with this? Are you dealing with this now? These types of things only seem to happen to people with depression and other mental illness, which is one of the cruelest things imo.",0
"The past two years have taught me never to hope. Hope is a very big mistake to be making. Every single time I have hoped for the best, or looked forward to the future, it has been taken away without any real reasons and denied. This is not me. I used to love waking up in the morning and I used to love going to school, going home, going to bed. I loved EVERYTHING because I was looking forward to everything. Now what? Days are a fucking blur and all I'm thinking about is the next time I'll be suffering, whether it be dealing with terrible bosses at an underpaid, over stressful job, dealing with angry people, or worrying about not doing the shit I should be. I used to be on top of my shit, and now I feel like I am helplessly behind. I want to hope, but I will hate to see myself be wrong again. I want to hope this year will be better, but I remember making that same promise last year for 2016. It was not better, just same shit different year. I don't really want to hate my life, but I can't help it. I don't think I'll be able to save myself, but I don't know who even could. Thanks for reading my thoughts, just looking for opinions about this, or even confirmations of someone reading it.",0
"I am turning 29 tomorrow. I don't even want to celebrate because there is nothing worth celebrating. Poor, bald, fat, short, and alone. I am going to be a 29 year old friendless virgin. I have no fucking future. This morning I heard my roommates and their friends talking about how awkward and ugly I am, laughing hysterically. Just a fucking worthless shitty year. I used to look at posts like this and think, I have time. Things will be better when I get to that point, that age. They are not. It is the 29th year of unmitigated failures. I don't want to be here any more.",1
"Not usually a poster. I lurk about on this subreddit and like dabbling with video game related ones as well. I woke up today and this entire last month just so down, having my birthday, christmas and new years all together makes for bad decembers each time. I don't have any friends to talk openly with and it can really suck at times, but reading the posts here and seeing these long, heartfelt replies really helps me through each day. I want to say thank you to every redditer that takes time out of their day to reply to an OP. I also want to send love out to all the people that wake up everyday and fight their demons. The time spent by all the OP's and commenters here is of immeasurable value and just a single person to talk to is a world of difference. :)",0
"Holidays often feel like a painful reminder of what I want more than anything - a group of friends to celebrate with, a special someone to spend the night with, and freedom from all of my social anxiety. Something so simple as sending a quick merry Christmas text to my crush is so difficult for me, but this year I found a way to do it. Getting a response back while I was in the car on my way to seeing relatives I wasn‚Äôt looking forward to seeing made me smile and feel for a brief moment like I‚Äôm a normal person who could have those things. I wish that feeling could stay and not feel like an illusion that vanishes too fast.",0
"I just can't do it. I lost all my high school friends. My family situation is at best toxic. I've come close to killing myself every time I've come back. I honestly only do come back for my dogs and because my parents are paying for school. I barely survived 12 days of winter break, and being forced to come back here for four months for summer, I don't think I'll make it out alive. I'm already dreading it, the anxiety attacks are already kicking in. This is just too much.",0
"I don't visit this subreddit that often, but every time I do I leave feeling like I don't belong; I feel like I'm just a whole lot weaker than anybody else here. I read the posts and stories that all of you are going through or have gone though and despite being able to relate to a certain degree, it doesn't feel like I've gone through it to the same degree that you've all dealt with. I feel like a fraud, like I'm just another millennial feeling down on his luck and glamorizing the idea of having depression because it's easier than admitting I'm some sort of a brat unable to pull myself through some shitty times. I don't know anymore",1
"I'm so fucking stupid. I should've kept pretending like everything was ok. I finally opened up to 2 of my best friends about how I've been suicidal recently. They got really upset and started telling me how selfish that is, and they're right. I knew they've both dealt with suicidal thoughts before, and it was insensitive to bring it up around them. Since then they stopped talking to me. I've never felt worse about myself and dealing with it alone isn't helping. At this point I'm ready to die. I'm failing out of school, I can't start a relationship, my autism is getting worse, and I won't even have a place to live next month when I turn 18. My one reason for not ending it already were the few friends that I did have, but now they're gone too, so I don't have a reason to stay alive anymore",1
"Today I was sulking around because I really wanted ramen but if course, since it's New Year's Day, nothing is open. I was already hangry, had made myself some chicken in the oven, but set the heat too low, so it came out frozen. I was fumed and was ready to cry because I was so hungry and just really wanted some ramen. And, because all we've been doing this weekend is going to parties, we didn't have food at home. My mom was really annoyed that I was sulking and she asked me why I was feeling the way I was feeling. I just told her that I felt I was a 5 year old that wasn't getting their favourite food for dinner and that I'll be fine after I finish being sad. And then she said ""well maybe if you stopped sulking so much you wouldn't have depression."" after that I told her to fuck off and that what she said was an insensitive thing to say to anyone who was depressed and that she was lucky I'm not suicidal. I'm trying to let go of this situation now. Trying to cheer myself up by watching some Graham Norton, which usually works, but now there's this huge tightness in my chest and I can't breathe properly. My mom has always been, and for as long as she doesn't open her mind up a little bit, she will always be the most frustrating person to talk to about my depression. I'm so happy I'm seeing a therapist, because in all honesty, I have no one to talk to who will understand without being frustrated.",0
"Ever since I started college (I'm a junior now) I feel so different than the person I was in High School. Back then people would tell me that I was funny, chill, nice, I was genuinely interested in people and made friends easily. But now I feel the opposite, like I'm just a dick, I never want to hangout with my friends and these are guys I have been best friends with since I was 5. We were literally inseparable, but now even keeping up with them in our groupme has become a chore, at this point my friends don't even want to talk to me anymore. Recently even the thought of having a social interaction is so scary that when it actually happens I feel like I seem distant and uninterested causing people to dislike me. I wish I knew how/why this all started, I just want to be me again, not this boring asshole who never has anything to say. I haven't told anybody this because I'm afraid they either won't believe me or think I just want attention, and I really just don't know what to do. Its like I just want to be left alone but I know that is not how I want to live my life. Sorry for the rant I just feel lost.",1
"Hello Reddit depression, I wonder if sometimes anybody else feels like this is the only channel that they have to communicate with other people honestly. I mean Reddit in general not just the sub Reddit depression. I post a lot on Reddit and I post about a lot of things that are personal to me that concern me and then have a large impact on my feelings. I have been diagnosed with generalized depression and anxiety. I am not suicidal but I feel like lately I am very apathetic about life in general. And while I don't really have a bunch of positive messages to spew Into The Ether I know that there are reasons to continue on. I know that the New Year can bring a lot of Hope to some people but can also bring a lot of dread and negativity to some also. So I'm going to ask you what are some things that you are not looking forward to in the upcoming year? I am not looking forward to continuing to be a very supportive and caring partner to somebody that isn't very good at expressing their appreciation or acknowledgement of it. That is not to say that they are a bad person. It is just that sometimes things get hectic and it is hard to see all of the little thing that somebody does for you to make your life easier. So seriously what are some things that you are worried or anxious about for the upcoming year? What do you hope that you can do better? Or what are you hoping that other people can do for you? Are you hoping for something?",0
"Hello. So I would like to preface this by saying that I have not been formally diagnosed with depression, but I figured this subreddit would be the best place to seek advice nevertheless. I hope you don't mind me. For a while now I have not been able find the motivation to do much of anything. When I have a break from school I mindlessly click through useless videos on Youtube or various useless articles. Virtually nothing holds my attention. I can't get through an episode of a tv show without reading something else. I can't read through interesting articles, I can't finish any books, I can't draw, I can't do any research or even clean my room. Essentially, I can't accomplish anything unless it pertains to a greater purpose than simply enjoyment, or if I have made myself accountable to someone else, and even then I have trouble finishing tasks. It was honestly difficult for me to get out of bed and shower for the past couple of days. I am on winter break currently. What makes me the most afraid is that I haven't been thinking-- especially thinking creatively. If I have a new idea to ponder, I never pursue it. I used to constantly be thinking of new art projects and writing prompts, even though they never came to fruition. In school, I am ridiculously bored. I am lucky if I pay attention for ten minutes straight in any of my classes. My grades are fine, however. Could I have some advice, please? I am saddest about my lack of curiosity. Even when there was nothing interesting to do, I always had my imagination, and now I am bored with my own mind. Anything you can say to help would be greatly appreciated.",0
"I told one of my best friends that I had feelings for her and she told me that she was already thinking of dating someone else. She was super sweet about it, but I'm still feeling pretty down.

"I'm 17 about to turn 18, I have good grades, could probably get into pretty much any college I want (beat 30 on my ACT), I'm moderately athletic, I'm not horrible looking, I have a loving family and great friends.

I don't know why but I swell with anxiety everytime I think of the future, I feel cold and alone, I really just want it to end and I just can't see any alternative",0

"Hey guys. Im in high school right now, and honestly I don't really have any hope. I don't get really good grades, my family isn't too great, and my few friends will head somewhere else. I am probably going to be a loner in college, and I have no talents or anything. I'm super insecure and I just don't see any hope. Which says a lot considering that I am in a terrible situation right now. Does anyone feel like life is really cold? I don't enjoy anything anymore and it's really just terrible. No one loves me and I wish I could go back to when I was a kid. Life is going by so fast and every second sucks. Can anyone else relate?",0

So ive just given up on doing anything. It won't matter Nobody cares about me anyway, I just am alone.

Ive only met my new therapist a few times, so I dont yet feel comfortable telling her everything detail for detail yet. I dont know how I will be able to make it through the year, sanely. I often feel that the only reason I can live to see tomorrow is because of my boyfriend, my small dieing family, and my three bunnies. If they all leave this year, I don't think I will make it. What is my next step? What do I do? tldr; Depression is kicking full blast for the first time in years.

I would go to lengths that would have serious effects on my life just to help this person. It has always been hard for me to trust other people or even have interest in other people, but this person started to feel like a friend to me. It shatters my heart to know that I was never appreciated even after spending so much of my life trying to be a friend for this person when a lot of others wasn't.

"The notes that we exchanged during my last few days at that high school, as well as the hug that you gave to say goodbye and farewell stayed with me. I carried it in my wallet, travelling towards my senior years in high school to the end of college. Perhaps you were kind. Perhaps you were pitying me. Perhaps I misunderstood what you were trying to tell me. I can't speak or think for you. So when I wrote you a message telling you how I felt, you read it, and you never replied back, deleted me, dropped me; completely eradicating my existence a year after I left, I still held that note. Did you hold mine? I would appreciate a response from you, even if it's this late in time. I just want to hear it from you. Why you spent time with me, and why you wrote me that letter. What was the use of being my ""friend""? I told myself I'd burn this note that you gave me once I've become happier. I'm going to burn it soon, not because I've become happier, but because I don't think I ever will.",0
"I still remember that image of you and him so close together in that hallway alone. It burned itself into my mind. I get it though. I wasn't as athletic or good looking as him, nor was I popular. My grades were slightly below average, so that didn't help as much. I know my situation before and now isn't your fault at all, but my whole experience with you was just terrible. I tried to look at the brighter side of things before. So, from what I've learned: 1. Don't get close to anyone that fast 2. She doesn't have any interest in you 3. When faced with a difficult emotion, think of nothing and it will soon go away. Side effects may include lack of emotion of practised long enough.",0
"I told myself to keep a fair amount of distance between myself and anybody back in high school, but you don't really change much when you get in college. I fell in love, and I tried to push out that thought. One sided on my part completely. Before that, you and I were really close. But it turns out you were the same as anyone I tried to get close with. As soon as we get close, the further away we became. I wasn't oblivious to people pushing me away back then. I knew the signs, I know how to read in between the lines. So why give me mixed messages? The amount of stress that whole thing caused me thinned out my hair. I already hate falling for someone, or in any case get too close with just about anyone, and then I had to trust you. I shouldn't have. I should have just kept you at bay like everyone else. Later on I knew that you slept with a friend of mine. I wish I hadn't met you at all. I wish that we never talked to begin with. Thinking of you only causes me grief, just like everything else.",0
"I'm starting to think about it a lot. I have no skills, I have no hobbies and I've never been happy with any job. I was happy with her for three years and she told me she loved me like no other then five months later is dating some other guy, I saw a photo of them together before the new years. She was probably just using me, she most likely cheated on me multiple times - certainly once since she gave me chlamydia. I loved her so much I had never felt so safe and happy or secure in my life until I was with her and I believed she was the most amazing woman I would ever meet or had ever met. I was kicked out of school young and I lost all my friends with that. I have been trying so hard for this past year to put myself out there and meet people but got no where. I feel so alone. I feel so sad. I am starting to lose confidence that I would never actually end my life I've thought about it since I was a child and always told myself I would never actually do it, life is full of possibilities but death is death. I don't care about possibilities any more and death is sounding more and more like relief and peace of this emptiness.",0
"I'm 20, and a sophomore in college. I struggled with depression in high school, but thought I got over it for the most part. When I'm at college and surrounded by friends, I feel great. But the second I am alone in my dorm, I feel like shit. And now that I'm on winter break, that feeling is magnified. I don't know if it's anxiety or depression or a mix of both, but I just feel like trash and I don't want to exist (no worries though; I'd be posting this on r/suicidewatch if i thought I was actually considering acting on that feeling.) I am sad. I don't have friends at home really, and I guess this has me all wondering, am I just predisposed to being sad? Like if I'm only happy when I'm busy and with other people, then is my natural state of being just being a pile of shit? And does anyone else ever feel this way? I'm good as long as I'm distracted I guess. But when I'm on break, all I do is lay in bed and fuck around with the computer or video games.

"It is often in combination with being sick. But I can just wake up in the morning and be unable to move my legs, and have great difficulty moving my arms as well. I have had it confirmed by doctors and psychologists alike that it is not physical. Something psychological is keeping me unable to get out of bed. It has been suggested to me by my psychiatrist that it is repressed emotions. But most of what I am feeling is just stress, frustration and anxiety due to being unable to go to work. I feel like I will be let go because I have to constantly call in sick. (Not actually let go, just not getting my contract renewed) Does anyone else suffer with this? Has anyone overcome it?",0
"I'm sorry if this post don't really make sense, I just feel like, I need to get this off my chest. I am fourteen years old. About half a year ago I was in the worst possible part of my life ... until now I feel. I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety and OCD, I was hospitalized for a few suicide attempts. Back then I used to feel horrible. I wanted to die. When I was hospitalized I met this girl. I thought she was the most beautiful human being. We talked one day, and I quickly found out, that she was the most beautiful human being inside and out. Fast forward a few months. We've been talking quite a lot, and I've gotten to know her. I felt like she was losing interest in talking to me, if I would not start the conversation there wouldn't be a conversation at all, and so I decided to ask her out. We went to the city and just walked and talked for three hours. It was the best day of my life. She seemed so glad to see me, and I felt like she had a really good time. The next day it went back to normal, she doesn't really answer me, if I talk to her. I'm so scared, that she has completely lost interest in me and my existence, and I'm not sure what to do...",0
"I'm on a mobile and first time posting, long time lurker. So for that past two years I think I've been depressed, I've had to deal with a lot of losses. I thought and truly believed I was just 'tired' someone mentioned that I have zero motivation and zero interest in anything any more. I used to be the type that would rant and rave about the latest book, I couldn't tell you the last time I had an interest in a book. I work full time, come home and go to bed. I don't eat, I barley have a conversation with my family anymore and have 1 friend who I see once or twice a month. Other then that I lay in bed, in the dark and cry. I'm ready to get help, I don't want another year to pass me by, I want my old self back. Can anyone help with how I can speak to my doctor to about this, how do I open up? I've never actually said these things out loud as I have no one to speak to Thank you in advance for any help I can get!",0
"My wife completely dismisses my depression and also tries to tell me its just an excuse. If I am having an off/bad day she says I am just being an asshole and am trying to ruin her day and sometimes she even goes as far to say that I am ruining her life. I have times when I am down that I cannot be as attentive or give her 100% of my attention, but if I try to say I am just having an off day she says I am just trying to find an excuse for my behavior and not taking ownership of it. There have been days where she says she wants me to get out or leave and I have wanted to, so that I can get away from the pain, but I never do and I end up staying and hoping to just work things out or that maybe I deserve how she treats me. The only thing I feel is really keeping me there with her are out kids, who are the light of my life. I am just not sure what to do and what is going on with me, maybe there is someone else who has been through something similar and can offer words of advise.",0
I'm not sure if this is the right sub Reddit to place this question but I was wondering if anyone else that deals with depression also believes people are capable of reading your own thoughts.

"So I have been in depression for almost more than 2 years now. At the start of the those 2 years, I quit my job and literally spent 2 years sitting at home. Now I want to get back to life. However there is a constant thinking in my head that I am a loser. and that I have not achieved anything in life. which makes me wonder what should I do now. All I see is the darkness. I have started to believe that I need to get out of depression first before thinking anything about the career. Is that approach okay ???. If yes then can someone please guide me how to move forward ? I have already expressed myself on this subreddit the past week and the replies i got were encouraging. However I now think that there is a phase or gap between the mind filled with depressive thoughts and the optimistic mind looking for something for the career. I am 27 and will be 28 in 7 months and I want to transition from the former to the latter as soon as possible. can someone help me with that ? just for the reference (if anyone wants to read, this is my previous post) https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5k6k7g/i_have_wasted_my_life_and_i_have_no_idea_what_to/",1

I have a girlfriend. I love my girlfriend literally more than anything and it hurts me to know that there is a part of me that would do something like that. I don't know if I'm overreacting or if I'm just a piece of shit that should go die in hell. but this is really killing me and I don't know what to do. she has literally loved me so much and been there for me through everything in my life. and I have done this in return.

To summarize for you all: * They were involved in some deep stuff. * Some time back, they got their house broken into and while fighting the intruder(s) off, they received an injury in their head. * The injury increased the mental illnesses they had, one of them being Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. &gt; And this resulted a rise on violent seizures, traumatizing flashbacks, haunting voices that returned to the time they were in that deep stuff, not to mention that they can barely get out of bed. * They tried contacting with their family and friends, they tried going to professionals for help for their bodily and mental dysfunctions, but to their dismay, they (the doctors) gave up in the last moment. * Their friends just turned their back on them and they treat them unpleasantly.

"Maybe this post belongs in r/anxiety; I'm not quite sure. I do know that lately I've had this feeling that, on several occasions, has made me quite literally sick to my stomach. It's very hard to describe. See, I recently turned 18.

This nothingness has grown increasingly pervasive in my life. I want to go to college but feel it is not in my best interest at the moment. I want to take a year off and work but am worried a year might turn into a lifetime of dead-end jobs and complacency. I want sometimes to pass my house in my Jeep and keep driving. But what would that solve? I guess what I'm getting at is that I have no direction at the moment and nothing is calling me particularly loudly. I don't know where to go or what to do. I often find my eyes welling up and my fingers tapping my quivering leg with a sense of urgency, but alas I am still sitting. This yearning to do, to live, to experience coupled with my indistinct, unguided future, has birthed an uneasiness, a tension, that I haven't been able to relieve. Thank you for taking the time.",0

She said she doesn't believe in meds and won't refer me to a psychiatrist, but I can't self refer to any psychiatrists because the wait times in my area are so extreme that they only accept referrals for adult patients. I feel really comfy with her as a person and we've started to build a good rapport, but I've been struggling with intense anxiety since I was a child and depression for over a decade. I'm not formally diagnosed but I work in mental health care and I know what anxiety and depression disorders look like. I want therapy and I want to be psychiatrically evaluated and supported too. So should I try to switch therapists to someone who has a more similar medical philosophy to my own or stick it out with this one that I like so far (besides her refusal to help me get in meds)? I don't have a lot of people I can get support from for a decision like this so i appreciate any help or advice you guys have.",0
"Hey guys, first time playing here, just wanted to get some opinions. I've been on a variety of antidepressants over the years, and it seems that when my medication is not fully working I get this unwell feeling in my stomach. I'm not sad or unhappy, and it isn't emotionally triggered, there is just this awful feeling my stomach. It's not an upset stomach, it just feels unwell, and it changes my mood because it's all I can focus on. I was on Brintellix for a year and was a miracle drug for me after a year of finding a medication that worked. Symptoms then began about 3 months ago in the form of this unwell feeling in my stomach. We increased the dosage and symptoms went way with the change, and that lasted about 3 months until now. I'm now on Effexor wth mixed results after a month and a half. I take 75MG in the morning but the symptoms arise around the early afternoon. Has anyone ever had similar symptoms linked to their depression?",0
"And that'll never change.I could struggle to death to change something or not do anything at all, and things would be exactly the same.As you can tell, I have nothing, I am nothing.At this point, I'd be a fool if I thought there's any hope left for a loser like me.My teenage years felt like they weren't there in the first place.Never been to a party, a date, never got a driver's licence while everyone was posting pictures and congratulating each other after managing to do so on the first try(because I failed the test 4 times as I'm a stupid loser, not because of money), spent every single day on the computer as there's literally NOTHING else I could(and can) do and lastly never achieved anything meaningful while I was in school.After all, I guess this screen I've been staring at since forever is the only thing that keeps me going.But I guess this type of loser(that is me of course) needs to exist so that others can feel even better about themselves. I don't even know why I'm writing this.I suppose it is better that I stay awake so I'd be too tired to think about anything when the shitty college life resumes. I'll just always be as alone as it can get.Call me whiny and downvote this post if you want, I don't care.I've come to terms with the fact that NOBODY wants to do anything that involves me, so feel free to do what you want.At this point I've just given up really.I guess the only thing that could ever save this situation is death.",0
"I've had literal months to finish these two assignments for college (UK college, I'm 17, doing a fashion design course) and I've barely started due to a mixture of depressed feelings and fear of getting the work wrong and being thought of as an idiot. I was given an extension for one of them which was due before the christmas holidays but my tutor gave me until we go back for the new term, which is tomorrow. I haven't touched my sketchbook for the whole christmas holiday and I hate myself. I don't know if it was *because* it was christmas or if it just happened but I have felt like utter shit for the past few weeks. Maybe its because I'm falling behind in my work, but all I want to do is kill myself most of the time and that's not an exaggeration at all. I have two assignments due tomorrow, one that I've had an extension on already for the same reason, and I have to go in and explain why I haven't completed it again. I'm literally shitting myself about having to ask for more special treatment because of my fucking head not working properly. Plus I don't know how he'll react, like what if he says its fine but secretly thinks I'm just milking it to get more time for my work? What if he believes me but decides I'm not mentally capable of staying on the course? Not to mention the huge fear I have that he'll just blow up at me, which I highly doubt is going to happen because he's a very nice person, but I still worry about stuff like that. Thanks for reading this anyone, advice would be amazing right now. :3",0
"It's 01:12am right now. I haven't eaten in 2 days. I smoke two packs a day. The most sleep I've gotten in one night was 4 hours. I get stupid stoned every night. I don't care whether I lose my job after being unemployed for a year. I'm being pressured to live up to certain expectations. I sometimes drink a whole bottle on a week day just to see if that doesn't get me killed. I constantly imagine ways I could die from things i see on my way to work. I feel nothing yet I'm constantly terrified. I crave intimate contact but I always push those away that try and get close to me. I hate that it feels like people think I'm disgusting. Unattractive. No confidence. A burden. I saw a co-worker break down in tears today after hearing her father passed. I wished someone would cry like that for me. Let me just say I have the job I've been wanting since i graduated in 2012. The people I work with are the best people I've worked with so far. I've made many friends the past 2 years. My artwork has started to become popular on social media. Financially I'm quite stable. I kissed the girl I've liked for a while on New Year's Eve. Yet it seems there is no point to any of the good or the bad. Nothing matters. Nothing makes me happy. Nothing will save me. It's time I did something about the pain, so that it's finally over. Whoever reads this, please don't bother to comment anything supportive or encouraging. Save your time on something more meaningful",0

"I think the main reason it's so hard for me to overcome my depression is that it's actually a physical illness. It feels like having a really bad cold or flu all the time - not feeling like getting out of bed, general aches, grogginess, brain fog. Does anyone else feel this way?",0
"So the best I have ever felt while on antidepressants is for like 2 or 3 days after starting (didn't feel like sleeping for ever, had some evergy, had some motivation). Then as the medication levels out I feel like crap again. This has only happened with 2 meds that I recall: cymbalta, an SNRI, and wellbutrin. The same thing happened when my doc increased the cymbalta dose. So what I am asking is can anyone explain this? The only logical thing I can come up with is placebo effect because you should maybe start to feel better after 4-6 weeks but I only seem to get better for 48-72 hours and then go back to feeling the same as before that. But if it was placebo, why has it only done that with those 2 medications? The only other thing I can think of is that I have a different underlying condition that keeps counter acting the meds, but I feel like I'm just grasping at straws, but I'm sick of trying medications and the only relief I get is not wanting to die 24/7. I mean I still feel hopeless, worthless, and have passive suicidal thoughts most days.",0
"I feel like I have no purpose, and thus, no reason to live. I believe what I am experiencing is an existential crisis. I am at the point in my life when I have to figure out what I want to do with my life, and have to figure out where I'm going to go to college. As I see all of my friends classmates discover what they want to do, I am left behind. I am jealous and angry at myself for not knowing what to do. The only things I enjoy doing are playing video games, watching movies, reading/watching manga/anime, and hanging out with friends. Nothing else feels satisfying. I feel as though I either was born in the wrong time period, or shouldn't have been born at all. Do any of you have advice or guidance on what I can do to figure out what to do? I would greatly appreciate help.",0
"Title. Just felt like punching shit while I was in the car on the way back, just wanted to lose control but I didn't. Felt like cutting, going back to the drugs I just got free from, felt like just going back to my old self, just wanna shut myself away. Why does this shit affect me so much. Guess it's just cause it should be easy yet I can't not fail at least once first. Same happened with my permit, I failed the first time and felt worse then than I do now. Guess it's the embarrassment, my family didn't think I would pass anyway, they said they did but I could tell. My friend told me it'd be fine cause it's **easy** so I'd do fine, so where does that leave me. Just makes me feel stupid. I can't retake it for like 3 fucking months either cause I'm going back to school soon. Hopefully this doesnt come up when I'm there, less I talk to people less chance it will happen right, that's just how it is with everything tho. It's fucking embarrassing cause everyone else has already been driving for like 4 years and I just started last year, lucky them, I didn't live here until last year. This just sounds more and more stupid the more I talk about it, which it is. But it's embarrassing and just fucking annoying, can't handle embarrassment and it doesnt seem to matter how old I get, I never will. Not like anyone really expected me to do any better, they'll always just see me as a kid.",0

There's almost nothing that I can eat without feeling like vomiting, and even just getting something I can bring myself to bite is hard.

Should I just bite the bullet and wait until April/May to be seen by someone?",0

"I've been depressed for more than a year now, I am a teenager and self-diagnosed but I'm absolutely sure what I've been going through is depression. I confessed to my mother I was depressed once and she felt really awful, asking what she did wrong and it made me feel terribly guilty... so when she asked if I needed to be on medication and get professional help, I lied and said no so she wouldn't feel bad. Anyways, I've been going through these periods where I feel really good. Most of the time I'm content and sometimes I even feel happy. It lasts for a little while, last time for almost a month, and then I start slipping again. It's like a cycle, I'll feel good, then I'm depressed again and then, it gets really bad to where I'm seriously contemplating suicide. I don't want to die, I really don't, even when I say I do... but in those moments, it's serious. I hope you understand what I'm saying, I'm also extremely self-conscious, I've read this over a hundred times. Anyways, currently, I feel good again and I know soon that I'll probably return once again to a depressed state but, I feel really optimistic. This makes no sense, I'm sorry. WHAT I'M REALLY WONDERING IS: I'm not sure if I should be concerned or not. I want to ask a professional but, I can't tell my mom... so, I came here to ask if anyone knows what this could mean.

"Haven't had a job since getting out of the military ~1 yr ago. I've purged most things from my life and am finally selling my house this month. All in all I'll have no debt, car+dog, ~$40k, and ""full"" medical + $1300/month in va benefits. ~30, Loner, high iq, attractive, atheist, engineering background, several tinder flings last year. My residing in bed with a mountain of inertia has left me with needing two tooth caps, devolving physical fitness, increasing neuroticism, cynicism, etc etc. classic depressive spiral. I'm considering paying for expensive non-va counseling. Being stuck circling the drain is costly but so is seeking a historically futile chance at therapy. I sometimes wonder if it would be easier to hire a person to simulate being the subconscious driving force that all normal people have moving them forward in their various directions...if only to get me in a habit of being that kind of person. What is a man? Where did I stop changing things that dissatisfied me? How is my creature so prone to giving up?",0
"I moved to a new city away from my family and friends and ex-SO for the greatest job opportunity I could ask for right out of college. And somewhere along the line of my first real week of days off, I realized that all I did was work and I was just curled up in bed every second I was not working. I've thrown myself into a job so completely that I didn't even realize I stopped eating and slept too much. Now I'm back at work, and I didn't realize how lonely I felt being so far away from everyone I ever cared for. It's just a part of growing up, right? But I can't help but break down in the middle of my work day and lock myself in a bathroom trying to breathe. I've suffered from depression my entire life, but it has never been this bad. I've lost over 20 lbs and I was already only 5 foot and 110 lbs. And my apartment is pristine because no area but my bedroom has been used. It's been 6 months of this. I'm giving up and trying not to give up at the same time, if that makes sense. I decided to come home from work early today and cook myself a decent meal for lunch tomorrow, and it's the first thing I can say I'm proud of actually doing, but I feel pathetic at the same time. That that was all it took. I've been go go go my entire life. How do I stop and learn how to...survive?",0
"It seems like I was put into a family and city I don't belong in. So of course I tried to move around to find the right place but since it was right after highschool , I never found a good enough job to sustain myself, so I came home and went back to school. I've been back half a year, got straights As, and was pretty proud of myself. The hardest part for me is that I can't find a job, even though ive tried. Holidays are over, everyone's back to their own life , and I get hit with the backlash. Saying I'm useless and lazy because I'm not a working and productive person in the world. My dad basically told me I was a loser and if I'm not working by tomorrow I'm out of the place. Being told your useless , a loser, losing your place to live, for something you are working for , is a horrible combination to hit someone struggling with anxiety and depression. This time tomorrow Ill be homeless, and I don't have basically any friends from moving back, so I have no one I can turn to now but my own head is driving me into a downward spiral . I have been doing good depression wise. Doing the right things and the next best step, but now I have lost all motivation to even open my eyes. The past 2 days have been me waking and falling asleep crying knowing tomorrow I have nothing and no one, and contiplated ending it . Tomorrow im terrified because once it happens I know I'll loss all hope. If anyone can send any sort of encouragement it would mean everything. Thank you all.",1

"My psychologist gave me a new med to try and it was amazing. I felt 90% percent back to my happy self when on just my other meds I'm about 50%. Colors seemed to be brighter and I found myself feeling happy most days. Best 6 weeks ever. When she gave it to me she told me to stop taking it if the new med messes with my stomach too much. Well it did, to the point where any pressure on my stomach caused me pain and I would have to just lay down until the upset stomach subsided. I toughed it out for awhile because i felt so good but it just got to be too much so I stopped taking it about a week ago when it started making me vomit. I only have until next Monday until I see her again but everything is just awful. I feel like I'm worse off then before I took it and I don't know how I'm going to make it. Time is just dragging and every day is just awful. I find myself snapping at people and I just wanna cry all the time. It feels like when I wasn't taking anything. I haven't stopped taking my other meds just the new one. I just need a hug ;(",0

I grew up well normally i guess but as i git older and into middle school i started noticing wierd things like when i would argue with my brother he would call me retarded and small little things like people looking at me wierd,etc. when i went to alternative school for getting into trouble i was in a whole other section with other slightly off kids(there was a other section for people with much worse and noticeable illnesses? I guess) And now im a freshman more and more little things now that 2nd semester started i got put into special weight lifting (yes its for special people) but everyone in there looks normal like me and i have a freind in there aswell from that alternative school. My mental state is a piece of shit to say the least i cant concentrate for more than a minute i cant hold any conversations partly cause im socially awkward and have anxiety this has made me deppresed and suicidal while a completely shut down from the world. I do smoke weed twice every month or so and have tooken others to cope, i drink alot and heavily when i do, and smoke tobacco on the regular.

I had been on Zoloft 50mg and even got down to 25 mg for anxiety and depression. But during the later months of the semester of college. I got hit like a truck. I thought I was doing fine and adapting. But I guess not. I woke up feeling ""off"" and had acute anxious feelings about my well being and mental health. I've never really felt better. I feel empty. Lonely. I've been seeing a psychiatrist and therapist at school, and we upped my Zoloft to 150 mg with not much change in my mood. So now I'm on 100 mg of pristiq and have yet to witness any change.

It feels like she was my last chance at happiness, and that I am doomed to be alone forever. I do not want this pain. :-(",0
"This game hurts. Thinking of the game as a whole. I long for the friendship that Max and Cloe had. I never had any close friends, they were never caring and we lost ways. I spent my entire life alone, I wish I could have had a meaningful lasting friendship. I want to live in the gorgeous small town close by the beach and forest. I'm stranded here in the desert with plenty of dead trees, dirt, noise, bumper-to-bumper traffic and obnoxious sociopaths.",0
"I'm a lonely person but right now I don't have any friends or at least anyone I hang out with or talk to on a regular basis. I'm unemployed and living with my mom. So it feels like I couldn't hide those facts and I don't think any girl would be able to ignore all the red flags. That and I haven't dated anyone recently and my dating experience at the age of 33 is pretty spotty. Never been in a relationship either. Right now I feel like I need to focus on getting a job and getting back in shape because I've fallen off the wagon a bit. Also, I probably should try to get into some sort of activity where I could make some friends. Although, it feels like no one wants to make new friends the older you get. But I suppose I have to try anyway. Does that sound like a decent plan?",0
"After quitting a good job last summer after losing touch with the friends that cared about me after shutting my parents out after quitting school I feel empty the last thing I had was my mediocre relationship with my girlfriend who revealed to me she cheated and the only thing I could muster up to say was ""who gives a fuck"". I want to feel anger, be upset something...something normal but all I can fucking do is look at memes",0
"My mom killed herself. I am ugly and unattractive. This has been confirmed by several girls. I sometimes have this stutter that annoys me to no end. I could have tried harder. I don't see a meaning to anything. My mom killed herself and she was the only person who was really ever in my life. Life just pranks me at every corner doesn't it? If I were never born in the first place, would I miss this world that is so cruel to me?",1
"Hi, I've been feeling incredibly tired and lethargic lately. I'm on three fucking anti-depressant (citalopram 40mg, wellbutrin 150mg and elavil 30mg) and can't even function normally. I've been procrastinating most of my christmas break and don't see how I'll be able to go back to work in this shape. I have absolutely no motivation, I sleep or nap or am zoning out all the time. I'm having bad thoughts sometimes and I'm scared of my own brain. I think I should see my dr. about that. I'm at a new low point in my life and can't see shit turning around anytime soon. I feel like staying in bed and just giving up on being happy. At least that way I can't get worst than I am.",1
"College has been the worst experience for me. I started out at a community college and then transferred to a small city college in my town that I commute to. First of all, I hated both schools generally. I had always wanted to go off to college but couldn't afford it. Anyway, I have taken only a couple classes each semester because my depression started almost immediately when I first began school. Now it's two years later, I have nothing but general courses, I thought I'd try computer science and hated it...So I'm back where I started. And everyone I went to high school with are graduating now which makes me feel so much worse. I still don't even know what I want to major in. And I really don't want to stay here for two or three more years to finish a degree. Can anyone relate?",1
"Finally went to the doc after being in a nine month low, the lowest I've been in years. I started meds and my doc just upped them after my three week check up. She also gave me a pill to stop panic attacks. I thought I was making strides forward. Today my dad's girlfriend, a very nice and loving woman, died. She died the exact same way my mom died almost exactly six years later. I remained calm for him, but I'm having a terribly hard time. I'm just numb. I just don't fucking understand. Death just follows me. I don't know what to do. My boss told me to take tomorrow off. My dad lives 3 hours away and is snowed in so I can't really even go visit him. I'm drowning.",1
"I have just moved in with my gf in December, graduated a year ago and have begun working in a company. The company's a successful growth company. I have liked to work there, but there are some problems. I had a conversation with my bosses about my performance, and they said that they're not sure if I will get to continue there after the test period. I don't mind criticism, I know I can do better, but f.ex. right now I've been in a flu for about 3 weeks, and my boss has suggested that I shouldn't have a day off even though I would feel like it. Everything about this situation makes me feel pressurised, and I wake up every morning feeling reluctant to go to work. It's not nice to feel like every day matters at work, when normal routines are starting to feel like effort. When I get home from work, I usually just slob on the couch and watch comedies or other funny videos to feel better. I sleep quite ok, could do with a few more hours. I'm grateful to have gotten an opportunity to work in such a successful company. After all, in these times, even getting work is not certain. I have been depressed before. At that time, I was just 18 and trying to figure out what the hell was I doing. Ended up quitting my job then. Tl;dr: I work at a successful place, just moved in with gf. Felling pressure to do more at work, and at the same time feeling I should have time with myself. Would appreciate tips on how to get over this feeling.",0
"When I look at everyone around me, they all seem happy and motivated to live out their lives at least to some degree. They look like they have passions, and interests and things to live for. I can't seem to find any of these things for myself anymore. Everything feels so mundane. Pointless. I work and work and work and then I get this tax return that's lessens as I work harder. And for what? To build this life over my span of consciousness just to have it all disappear and mean nothing when I die? Life is painful. I feel like I have to fake emotions and reactions to things just to get through the day looking ""normal"" to everyone around me. This inescapable feeling of hopelessness just won't go away. No matter what I do. I try and change something and it still hangs over me. I feel like no one will understand the way I feel. I can't even fully understand it, let alone put it into words. I can't even bring myself to end it all because I think of how much it would hurt the only family I still have left. Everytime I've come close to ending my life, my mind floods with images of my sister finding my body and just breaking down. I can't bare to make her or my brother live with the pain of another dead family member after also losing our mom and dad.",0
"I'm having a bad month - make that six, no, a dozen, make that 2 years, wait, 6 years.... I've been trying to become ""normal"" for six. fucking. years. I've tried so many times to ""reset"" myself, but I haven't found a solution that lasts more than 2 weeks. I hate to log into this account. Sometimes I look into my post history to track how many days it's been since I was last broken, always to find that it's always less than 2 weeks. Why am I even trying? I don't know... I get up. I fall back down. Get up, fall down. Get up, fall down. My sometimes-optimistic self congratulates me for always getting up after every fall. But the depressed, brooding me scoffs.. It's like the depressed me knows this cycle is never going to end... The change that my sometimes-optimistic self hopes will happen, nah, not gonna happen. Ever. Am I always going to fall down every single time I try? I don't know, and I doubt you do either. I need some kind of divine intervention. A guiding hand that knows what to do. I hate myself right now.",1
"I just want people to enjoy spending time with me, but I'm just a sad sack of shit and always going around being pessimistic and depressed and shit, why would anyone want to be friends with me. All I can do is drain people with my sadness. I'm such a shit friend.",0
"Everyone thinks they need to call some place to apprehend me because ""oh you're not safe like this"" or whatever reason. I'm just really sad, I'm not going to hurt anyone or myself. I mention how sad I am to anyone who asks and it turns into a panic where they do anything to get away from me, even counselors. I'm so scared, I feel like my depression is just going to send me to prison or some facility no matter what.",0
"I'm sorry if this seems to be a ramble, but I need to get this out. I've been reading this sub for a while, but made a new account to comment. Sometimes I find it helpful to get everything out, and I don't have anyone left to get things out to who won't try and pity me. Depression runs in my family, but I'm probably using that as a crutch or an excuse. I think I'm depressed. I go through stages of downs and (sort of) ups, though those usually manifest themselves as drives to fix the problems in my life - while never working out and making the situation worse. Today my girlfriend called me selfish. Truth is, it's her birthday tomorrow and I haven't gotten her anything. She knows this, I haven't even gotten her a card. The reason is, I have a lot of personal debt - we both do. I spent my last ¬£2 on a sandwich yesterday so that I could eat, and now I have to hope that the rest of the month ""works out"" somehow. It's 13 days until pay day. I don't have a bad paid job, but circumstances this Christmas left me short for cash - I usually run out a few days before pay day not two weeks. She knows about my debt, some of it's hers, but I she doesn't seem to get it, how bad it is. I used to hurt myself. That was a long while ago, and I couldn't do it today for fear of actually having to explain myself. So there's no risk there. I'm just ready to...I don't even know. I'm broken. Help.",0
"A lot of really crappy things happened to me starting around this time last year, but I still felt alright because I had my friends, my band, &amp; especially a really great boyfriend. I have never felt as happy to be alive as when I was with him. But my band broke up, I fought with my best friend &amp; we don't talk any more, I lost more &amp; more friends, then eventually found myself single. I can't think of anything I've done to deserve losing everyone like this &amp; no one will tell me why it all happened. So now I have no confidence. I constantly wonder if I'm a good person because I don't understand why this happened if I am good. I'm afraid to make new friends because I don't think anyone will like me or that the new friends would eventually leave me, too. Probably also without an explanation. I also can't seem to get booked for any shows (playing music). I've struggled with depression &amp; anxiety my whole life, but never like this. I don't know what to do. I don't want to burden what few people I can still call friends with this because I want them to be happy &amp; I think it would just drag them down. Not to mention that I don't really trust anyone anymore. Just feeling so discouraged &amp; lost &amp; trapped.",1
"Hi all. Hope you are doing well. Just want to start off by saying thank you for hanging in there and sticking through tough times. I hope on everything good in this world there will be compassionate people to be with you throughout your journey. And I hope that one day you might be that compassionate person for someone else. I know you are. I come to you today for advice. (Thanks in advance for reading this) Does the mind rule the body or does the body rule the mind ?.. .I'm in a really strange place right now. I know I have depression (at least I believe I do with my family history). But I usually find myself getting depressed about things I see in the world. For example just seeing how much sex is exploited. Just seeing the thumbnails of YouTube videos of women showing off their breasts and how these videos have millions of views. It just bums me out. Seeing hate and violence on tv. It really just gets to me. I start getting really upset when I see how shallow/ easily tempted/ lead people are. Is this normal? Is it the world doing this to me, or is it my mind? I've basically lost everything these past few weeks..my belief in a god, my friends, my hopes. I now have only one real person I can talk to. I want out. And I've had enough, where is there for a person like me in the world to live ? Please anyone, comment your thoughts on this. What gets you depressed ? Is it common what I feel?",0
"Hi reddit, I would like to tell you a little bit about myself, and hopefully meet a great community to help me on my journey. I a'm a very quiet person, don't get much attention, and I spend all my time at home or at school.I'm 17 years old and tonight is my last day of Christmas break, and my last day of childhood since tomorrow is my 18th birthday (technically today since my birthday January 4th and it's already 1:50AM).I have spent my night drinking, smoking, and crying. The only thing I've been able to think about tonight is how dull and boring my 18 years have been leading up to this point. I haven't accomplished very much at all in 18 years and everyday i feel worse about it. Well I've made a firm decision to change my life tonight. Tomorrow morning is my first day back at school, and my first day as an adult,after two long and lonely weeks of Christmas break. I've been ignoring my depression for a long time now, and I'm just now starting to acknowledge the reality of it. I'm already trying to get myself on the right path and basically this post is some sort of icebreaker to try and get involved in the community and to get some tips on staying positive, and some positive and insightful perspective on my life. Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this. I will be replying to comments tomorrow after school, good night to everyone and I hope you all have as great of a day as I will tomorrow.",0
"I wish it would go away. My brain struggles to handle the fact that nothing matters and becomes disgusted with things like religion that give hope. Everything is so seemingly random and purposeless. Whenever I think about my life, I always feel so out of control. I had no choice in my existence. Everyday life without my distractions of fantasy..through games and TV shows..is meaningless and awful, yet I must participate to keep consuming the media that I truly live for. I work and get education in an exhausting cycle every day..for an uncertain future in a VERY fucked up and disgusting world in light of recent events. How do I cope with the feelings of dread that wash over me? I guess I'll try to answer for myself. I just keep distracting, keep consuming media that gives my life interest and purpose. Yet, as of late even that hasn't been enough. I need the bigger distraction of other people I guess. I want to socialize and build relationships to strengthen my life's meaning, but this is really, REALLY fucking hard. Reaching out to people in today's American society is like jumping off a bridge in which you'll land on your feet or face first. As an American, superficial and acquaintance relationships dominate. The real struggle is to create something more. I'm really afraid that my exhaustion will soon outweigh my desire to consume more media and the relationships I have by the time I have my BA degree. I can just end the suffering, the pain, the world, MY world, at any time.

"So girl I like is very flirty when she's drunk. Actually that's the reason we're not together. She knows that it hurts me and she doesn't wants that. Recently she found someone and thought he was the one, even started to avoid me I'm guessing cuz she didn't want to hurt me. Well he didn't last and was only using her and we started talking again. Last weekend we went out with some friends she got drunk and flirted with some random guy again which it didn't affect me much. When he left she flirted with one of my friends. That actually affected me. The weird part is that she wanted to dance with me but only in private but she has no problem dancing with some guy or even friends. I don't know what that means. Damn it girls are complicated. She keeps treating me different idk if that's good or not. She won't text me but gets offended if I don't text her for long periods. Is she playing with me? Wth is going on? Thanks for reading this long. It sucks being me right now. I've become so confuse and insecure just from one girl.",0
"I pretty much spent the whole of last year quite depressed. I knew something was up with me so recently I started taking anti depressants (non SSRI) and only now im actually starting to feel something, do I realise just how long I was numb for. It was hard to describe to my girlfriend that I wasnt upset or unhappy I was just unable to feel anything at all... I would have loved to have been able to be unhappy about something. To feel the intense emotions of unhappiness (like from a break up or something) would've been such a welcome change from the void I was in. I've definitely got a long way to go but the anti depressants I've been taking (mitarzapine) has shown me the first glimmer of hope I've had in a while.",1

I just felt nothing, like I was waiting for it to end. For last 3-4 years it has been hard for me to feel anything. I haven't been feeling suicidal at all but I wish I could feel. I haven't been happy for awhile, just want to lie in bed all day. I don't even know what to do anymore. I feel like a hamster in a wheel, just moving in place. I have always been the odd one in the family, I try to put on a smile. I smile on the outside but inside is nothing. The family disappointment, the one who everyone sees as the family loser.

No one in my family is doing anything to help me, I just want to drop out, but I can't because I want to make them happy. I don't even know what I'd work as if I dropped out, but I'm on that road anyway seeing as I haven't been going to school. Why is going to school so easy for people that aren't like me? It's so annoying to have no one to relate to and I have no one to ask for help. I'm just getting really tired of staying home and doing nothing.

I hate other people‚Äôs happiness, when someone accomplishes something all I do is think about my failures. I obviously am outwardly supportive, but inside I‚Äôm so resentful. I feel like am truly an awful person, I don‚Äôt remember the last time I was genuinely happy for someone. I really just cannot connect with people on any emotional level anymore. I just feel like alien. Does anyone else feel this way? Or do you try to make other people happy to make up for you not being happy yourself? Does this help you, as in does other people‚Äôs happiness help to alleviate yours slightly? &amp; also, to people that don‚Äôt resent other people‚Äôs happiness, how?

Well, one thing worse would be staying home to watch millions of pounds/euros/dollars/whatever being absolutely spunked away on fireworks, right overhead of the poverty/homelessness stricken major cities of the world. How anyone enjoys those things is beyond me. You've gotta feel bad for the animals too, domesticated and wild... Anyway, best wishes and all that jazz, my dudes. Edit: Just pretend I said ""the one time of the year to feel more out of place than Xmas"" and forgive my 4am brain for the shit post title",0
"Friends, On a throwaway here for now. I had to write/speak to someone so I've decided here is the best place. With the New Year approaching, as well as getting back to normality and work after the Christmas break, I feel even more down and worried, particularly about my lack of resilience. A bit of a background - about 4 months I moved with my partner pretty much half way around the world. It was a move we both definitely wanted and I have no regrets at all from that - however it's again where I think my resilience decided to leave me. I also need to travel weekly (only usually the first three days of each week, so two nights pretty much) for work - it was either that or they said 6 months of little to do within state... I think being bored 9-5 is even more depressing! Now I'm desperately struggling to keep happy and I have this low to medium level of anxiety that just won't go away no matter how hard I try and think differently. I'm struggling with the flying (I'm already a little anxious but it now feels much worse), I struggle with being alone and away from my other half, I struggle a little with being away from home. The annoying thing is, 6 months ago, I wouldn't care less about being away from home! Or spending time alone! How do I go about just getting my resilience back and being able to deal with things? I wish wish wish I could be like, oh, so I have to fly out on Monday, big deal, I'll be back soon, make the most of it! I just want this anxiety to go away and leave me in peace! Thanks for listening.",0
"parents and relatives, every gf i had ended up breaking up with me. No friends. Havent had a hug in about half a year. Have a lot of mental illnesses that do not allow me to live the life of a normal human being. Cling to any person who shows me any sign of attention. Basically an /incel. So the thing is, i really want to leave this world at my own terms, every day is more painful than the last - physically and mentally. Ive already tried cutting my veins and yesterday i started a small controlled ""campfire"" in my house in an attempt to kill myself. Unfortunately i turned chicken and put the fire out. I am desperate. What to do?",0
Whenever I think about ending it all I think about my parents crying over my body. So I just keep trucking through this miserable existence as a proxy for my parents' happiness.,0
"My depression is catching up to me... again... right when I think I'm doing alright, the drowning begins again. I'm tired of running around in circles to get away from my demons only to end up consumed by them anyway.... My life has been constant ups and downs, from abusive parents and partners, to self sabotage and circumstances out of my control that almost ruined my life... When am I going to stop being punished....? I'm a good person.. I try to be... why do I keep getting handed sour lemons when I try so hard to be happy and make good lemonade?",0
"I'm not a strong person. At all. I've had an ok life, but I was coddled and overprotected for the majority of it. Now I'm 22 and every time something happens to me, I tell myself that I would honestly rather die than fixing it. I'm pretty obese, and my roommate tells me that I need to lose weight. I honestly would much rather put a shotgun under my chin and end everything. I don't want to work for anything, I don't really want to put effort into my life, especially when I already hate it so fucking much. I drink about 2-4 energy drinks a say too, so I'm pretty much just waiting for a heart attack to happen. I don't know why I'm posting in here. If you think that wanting to kill myself over these things is stupid, then you can honestly fuck right off. I'm sick of being told that, and the only thing that does is make me want to end it all even more.",1
I want the attention at least. Stabbing some human trash or just suicide by cop I think I should turn myself to the police. I'm going insane,0
"All my life people asked me why And every answer I gave was a lie You'll feel better by the way you dress Maybe, just maybe I'm just depressed You'll feel better if you sleep well often Maybe I would rather lay down in a coffin You'll feel better if only you'll try I try and try but I still want to die You'll feel better if you see your friends Maybe every beginning looks like an end You'll feel better if you hit the gym Maybe feeling bad is simply a sin You'll feel better if you leave it behind Yet I'm left with nothing, chewing the rind You'll feel better if you let it all go How hard I have tried, nobody knows",0
"It seems petty that I have to post on a forum to announce my own suicide, and not to mention that if I really wanted to die, I wouldn't be attention-whoring myself, but I would at least want to say goodbye to this world that I've lived in as a respectable leave-off, almost like a resignation letter in a job, even if it was just a single post on the internet. Please consider that I have no one to say goodbye to, I have no family, I have no religion, and I have no friends, the internet is all I have. I am looking forward to finally have everything lifted off my shoulders. In approximately 4 hours, I will be leaving, so I say goodbye not to this subreddit, but to all the people that I will be sending this reddit post link to, and generally everyone reading. Gabe",0
"I tried I really did but my emotions always seem to come back. My mom has told me that these are just ""fake emotions"" and if I press them down I wont even feel them. The problem is im not really sure what emotion is anymore. I hate my mom for trying to help me with shitty advise that just makes me feel worse.",0
I try to do good Things but I always go about it the wrong way. I can‚Äôt do this anymore. It hurts too bad. I don‚Äôt know how to be happy. Maybe I‚Äôm just not wired that way.,0
"Apparently they ""reset"" a depressed brain by activating certain areas that increase feelings of wellbeing for months. Has anyone ever tried it?",0
It all started in fifth grade.. It was there I realized what was loneliness and being an outcast. I feel like an outcast honestly everywhere and I feel like garbage of who I am. From 5th grade to (currently)10th grade I have been becoming more and more depressed. At first it just started as sadness from time to time but around 9th grade it really kicked into overdrive. Its gotten to the point where I don't truly laugh anymore or anything not even my own family make me genuinely happy. To make matters worse I probably don't have it as bad as some people here but idk why I can't get that through my head...anyways have a happy new years everyone.. Heres to another year of depression lol.,0
"What is even the point? Walks are boring, I hate shopping, and I have no clue or ability to socialize on my own with new people. Why should I ever leave my house? Work is not a suitable answer because I dont have to and will rather throw myself off a high building before I have to do that again.",0
"I thought this year was going to be different. I thought I was finnaly going to be happy for once in my life. I thought this girl was going to be the answer I was looking for.. instead I am chasing someone that just made me irrelevant. I guess college does change someone, or I probably Fucked up somewhere along the way. Who knows! I guess I just wasn't good enough......",1
"I just got to thinking about how much time I spend alone. Throughout elementary and middle school I had some friends that I hung out with. I lost them all when I went to high school, where I was forced to make new friends. None of those friendships stuck though, and I never hung out with any of the people I talked to. Imagine that: four years of going to school and coming home and spending all that time by yourself. I got to wondering tonight what that does to a person‚Äôs psyche‚Ä¶ I like to think I introspect a lot and I‚Äôm a thoughtful person because of it, but I think the more likely outcome of all this is that i‚Äôve become socially awkward, paranoid, and bitter towards the people around me. I am like a social and societal disease. Every room I walk into its like I am sucking all the energy from everyone there. It‚Äôs like that in college too. I just started last semester and I‚Äôve made no friends. i know people in my dorm or in my classes think of me as as that girl with no friends. They either pity me or ignore me like the plague. Sorry for the weird rant. Just wondering if anyone else feels like this‚Ä¶",1
"I have improved my life significantly over the past two years: I found an antidepressant that works for me, I've gone back to school, I've got a steady job, I've even gone on a few dates, and I adopted a dog to give me a place to focus my attention and love on. I thought that if I could improve myself, or at least improve my situation, that it would feel better, and in some ways i guess it does. The depression is still there though. It's not as constant ,and in fact as long as I'm around someone, my friends, my family, or even my dog, I feel alright. But it never really goes away. Sometimes I'm watching a movie, or listening to a song, or taking too long to go to sleep it hits me. In these moments I remember that I'm a useless waste of life. All of my accomplishments are stripped away to reveal the fact that I'm just a bunch of nothing. In time it goes away but it's never too long before I revisit those feelings. Is it the same for anyone else? Can you truly ever ""get over"" depression?",1
My ‚Äúfriends‚Äù never talk to me unless I‚Äôm the only one available and I‚Äôm so sick of it but I don‚Äôt want to burn those bridges cause I know it‚Äôll hurt more to get rid of them altogether than to just suck up the pain of being left out,0
"tonight something strange happened. i was out with friends, we drank a little (i had about 3 drinks in 3-4 hrs) and when we left, we decided we‚Äôd go to the closest friends‚Äô house and continue to drink. i was by no means wasted. out of no where my chest began to tighten and my heart started racing. at the last second, i asked to be dropped off at my parents‚Äô. i told my mom what happened and she suggested that it was an asthma attack. I‚Äôve had asthma attacks, and this didnt feel like one (no wheezing/ out of breath) it just feels like no matter how much i breath, i can‚Äôt get enough air. and it also feels like my heart beat is extra loud? if that makes sense. also, it‚Äôs vey uncontrollable. there was no immediate stresser, but i have been stressed about life in general lately. like what i‚Äôm going to do in the future, a job, etc. the whole episode lasted half an hour or so. i also get this feeling when laying in certain positions, being too hot, and feeling too constricted. none of these took place tonight, though. is this a panic or anxiety attack? does anyone else get this?? any help is appreciated :) add on: the feeling is similar to as if someone were holding my heart and lungs in their hands, and slowly tightening their grip. not sure if that makes sense but it‚Äôs the best way i can think to describe it",0
"He has depression. He told me that he lost someone important to him and he's been feeling emotionless since. This person apparently passed away without warning and it was within the last month. We were somewhat dating and I noticed he pulled away, which I thought was him ghosting, but he said he was ready for a relationship with me before this happened. I'm not sure what to do now... or what to say to his messages explaining this. Any advice? Should I offer to see him in person or do you think he doesn't want anything to do with me right now? As an fyi, I've never been to his house and don't know where he lives specifically so that's not an option.",0
"I hate every single thing about myself and I don't know how to stop. My looks, my personality, my body, my voice, everything I do makes me hate myself a little more. If i didn't have a family that loved me and if I had the guts then I wouldn't stick around. It's too painful to be in this state of mind all the time. I'm ruining my relationship with the love of my life because I hate myself so much that I can't bear to be intimate with him. I truly am disgusted by myself. I avoid showering because I feel like crying every time I look in the mirror. I need to know how to stop hating myself. My therapist tells me I need to learn self-compassion but I feel like that's literally impossible. Sorry, just need to get it all out but I really am at a loss. At this point it honestly blows my mind that there are people that actually like themselves. What I wouldn't give to feel that way.",1
"I have a long story but don't feel like giving all the details right now.. I graduated high school 6 months ago. I was supposed to move elsewhere and work for about a year before deciding whether I should go to college. Those plans didn't take place, so... I've been staying at home since then. Yet, long before that (Perhaps for the past 2 or 3 years), I've been really declining, just barely passing my classes and even failing calculus twice. Slowly spiraling into depression although I was never sure until now. And now that I'm out.. I'm pretty much depressed. So many things that stress and worry me. I can never get anything done, I never feel interested in anything, I always feel tired.. And yet my mom has kind of been pushing me into getting a job while the move situation gets resolved. It really seems like the right thing to do. Yet the idea just feels terrifying. Like I KNOW I should find one, bu I also dread the idea. Probably my anxiety acting up, but also because I worry it'll only make me worse. I'm constantly on-edge and just about anything can ruin my mood for the rest of the day. In my mind, I tell myself that I'm in no condition to work full-time but then I feel guilty because that might just be an excuse. And just a few minutes ago, a cousin messaged me saying there was a spot I could take at a hotel that he works at. And again.. That feeling of dread, the guilt for even feeling like this, and overall just wanting to decline but not knowing how to say it. Thoughts?",0
"I‚Äôve had friends in the past tell me they think I have depression and that I should seek help, but if anything this makes me irritated and want to get help even less. Why is this? Does this happen to anyone else?",0
"My own fucking problems aren't enough anymore. I've gotten so used to my shitty life and the thought of wanting to die that I can't cry anymore when I'm depressed. But crying helps. It comforts me and most of the time I feel better afterwards. So every time I'm in my bed and want to cry, I browse this sub. Some of the stories on here are just so sad that I can't help myself. It's weird. I know. And I kinda feel like thanking you but that would seem out of place since you're just here to find help too. I don't even know why I'm posting this here. I just wanted to tell someone and my friends don't give a fuck.",0
I spent a lot of time pouring my heart into a semi new friend group that I knew decently well in high school.they‚Äôre very smart people book wise and I like talking-to them sometimes but it feels empty I miss my old friends I hold onto 3 out of 6 of my old friends. Anyways I offered to my new friend group that I would host a New Years party at my house and they like were really into it but oddly controlling. I invited 2 of my older friends but unknown to me my new friend group had problems with them. One of my old friends was a old boyfriend of one of my new friends girlfriend and apparently caused a lot of ‚Äúharassment‚Äù mean while this all happened 2 years ago.... I know the girlfriend isn‚Äôt mentally stable she‚Äôs off she almost killed my old friend twice but like I thought I‚Äôd be okay to invite my old friend but I just got shit on by basically all my ‚Äúnew friends ‚Äú I was basically forced to uninvited my old friends but instead I cancelled the party and am now having a ‚Äúsecret‚Äù party with my older friends. I feel like my new friends are a cult I feel like an outcast. I‚Äôm just crying in bed because I just can‚Äôt find new friends. I poured my heart into people i thought that were good people but apparently they‚Äôre so immature,0
Please I need to talk to someone.,0
"It's totally arbitrary, and that really isn't a problem (any made-up reason to celebrate is fine) except that it makes me think about how miserable I was last New Year's, and every year as far back as I can remember - which is something I would never otherwise think about. I mean, if I am depressed on May 3rd, I am not also upset that I was depressed on May 3rd last year too, because it cannot help but escape my notice. But I know I was depressed on New Year's Eve of 2016, and every year I can remember before that. It's the same every year, and that makes me feel even worse than I normally do. What's worse, it marks another year during which I was totally miserable. Every New Year's Eve, I am made to reflect that I felt just as bad over the last year as I did the year before, often worse. I don't feel any better about anything in my life after a whole year having passed. Every year I tell myself that I am trying harder than I ever have to be better, and that there is some prospect that in the next year there will be something in my life that makes it worth living, that takes a little bit of the pain away. But every year have to realize that I was wrong. I was thinking exactly the same thing earlier this year, but now I realize that I was wrong last year and I will be wrong this year too. I would not be thinking about any of this if it weren't New Year's Eve.",0
"I've always been a bit of a ""short fuse"" personality, but never actual rage towards small things. Lately the tinniest things have been throwing me into a fit.

Each day I value myself less and less.",1
"Just turned midnight here on the east coast. As I head to bed I am... texting with my ex, dreading all the calls I'll have to answer tomorrow, reflecting on all the ways 2017 sucked, and realizing how little I bring to the table as a person. ""But nothing will ever change. The cycle of mediocrity isn't due to some obstacle. It's who you are. The thing standing in the way of your dreams is that the person having them is **you**"" Not really looking to feel better, just wanted to rant and keep this pity party up for a bit longer. Anyway happy almost 2018, everyone!",0
"Every idea I've had since I turned 15 has either been something I've already come up with or something done already. Why can't I be as creative as I was when I was younger? Some of my ideas were stupid, sure, but they were still *interesting*. Nowadays tho I find myself drawing the same thing over and over and it's pretty monotonous--but I just can't draw anything else.

"Anyways, I know that you guys aren't doctors, but I have a question. I am on medication, but yet all day long, I feel panic, trouble breathing and shaking all day for like no reason. I can't identify any of the stressors, it just comes on and makes me really tense, irritable, etc. I can't even really identify anything I'm scared of, I just feel like my body is having a biological reaction and is creating tension. Are drugs for anxiety appropriate for this? I thought SSRIs are for people who are struggling with problems but I am not struggling with a problem with my thoughts entirely right now.",0

"is this a depression thing? is this a medication thing? (i'm on lamictal, lexapro and seroquel). i noticed that my dreams are very intense and vivid and i remember them with much more detail than before, also I wake up a lot more in the middle of the night.",0
I don‚Äôt belong here on earth... I am just way too different... Society despise me...,0
I can't fall asleep. Is 5:06 am I just went down stairs and ate a lot of food and now I hate myself.,1
I just don‚Äôt know why I don‚Äôt commit suicide and die Life is full of pain and misery I have done nothing wrong and I have tried so hard but i just cannot find the happiness that I deserve My Lord I ask you for nothing but my happiness,0
Now I am listening to Pink Floyd's The Wall album on opioids and contemplating on what went wrong. Of course I can live without you. But please remember there was a moment in my life when you made me feel like I can't. *sad reacts only*,0
"I question my purpose daily. Will I ever find the ""one"" for me? This spiral of emotions I deal with on a daily basis has me emotionally numb if that makes any sense. It's noticable in day to day conversation. Praying for better days",0
Anyone else feeling like nothing matters? I feel. Like it would just be better to end it all. Like nothing matters,0
"This has by far been one of the toughest years of my life, I hit rock bottom about a month ago and honestly thought I'd never get away from it. I was gonna sit in tonight feeling shit, playing games but I've decided to go out and get drunk. Cheers to all of you! Here's to tomorrow, it might be shit, it might not but I'll drink to both",0
"In new year¬¥s eve my family comes to my granfother¬¥s house to have dinner, but that¬¥s not good or fun, that¬¥s sad and terrible. My uncle hates my family, becouse my aunt controles my uncle. My two cousins don¬¥t know nothing about that, one of they have one year ago and the other have five years ago. Always when i eat with my uncles something happens, and this time if something happens, i¬¥ll out of the house and have a walk, fuck, i don¬¥t like this sittuation",0
but happy new year redditors.,0
"Why is it so hard? Why is it so painful? Why won't the voices go away? Why me? I have the perfect life. Loving, beautiful girlfriend, best parents ever. Got the scholarship not many people can get. Why does it hurt so much? I can't take it anymore. I think I'll do it tonight.",0
This dec was also the first time I've felt so down in my life because of so many trials and problems at home and school.,0
I can't make up my mind with ANYTHING. I'm tore between wanting to do things &amp; not wanting to do them at the same time. Anyone else?,0
"many people are enjoying this new years eve with their friends,families,lovers and whatever. but me here depressed at home and not feeling like its new year eve and not excited for 2018 and dont have anyone to celebrate with or have friends to wish me new year.",0
"Don't think 2018 will be any better for me. I'll still be lonely, will have no one to talk to and afraid to leave my house. No one even knows me except my family. No one in my neighborhood knows me. I spent weeks inside my house. Hate this life üò¢",0
"So 2017 was probably the worst year of my life, I lost a lot of family members and my best friend. Recently I found out that I can't really feel anymore. No emotional pain, no excitement or happiness. Can someone tell me if this is normal or should I get help?",0
So yeah what the title says. I'm the one who ended the relationship though as it was toxic AF already. I shouldn't feel anything regarding the matter since I ended it. Yet I'm getting separation anxiety and loneliness on top of what I've been feeling prior. Help.,0
Mine seems to be being ignored or when I have reason to believe i might be abandoned by someone,0
"It's the same shit every. damn. time. Nothing's gonna change. I'll stay miserable as always. It's always been like this my entire life. There was no hope, I was just delusional. I'm just waiting for the day I can finally kill myself with nothing to stop me.",0
"I guess I just started to realize that all of this ""new year new me"" is bullshit and I'm going to stay the same loser in 2018 so I'm not getting my hopes up",1
"You will die no matter what you accomplish or what you do why do we live when we will just go to sleep forever anyway I‚Äôm finding it hard to comprehend, one thing that‚Äôs certain is death",0
"I get this extremely sad feeling, asking myself if I am really happy. I reflect on the past year, and on the things that passed. NYE feels like a binary switch between a cosy Christmas holiday and a cold winter period that lasts until March. Is there anyone here that recognizes this feeling?",0
Nobody thinks self harm when it's just bruises. But now he's weighed down with my bullshit as well.,0
"And whenever I am a bit agitated, it's just absorbed like a damn sponge. Does anybody else have similar experiences?",0
and things get really bad so that i can finally kill myself. I'm so sick of not able to kill myself because there is always this voice saying it's not that bad and not having enough courage because things are not that bad. There is no point anymore in trying so hard every year when nothing gets better. I'm so tired of living like this and waiting for nothing. And happy new year to everyone with mental illness and i hope this year turn out to be great for you all.,0
"It happens at least twice a week: some jerk cuts me off when I'm talking or a coworker simply ignores what I just said, and I instantly start hating on myself. ""People interrupt me because I'm a wimp."" ""I'm the only one they treat like this."" Anybody else?",1
"Another year spent completely alone, is finally over. Maybe 2018 will be a better year? who am I kidding, Im going into the new year lubed up for the A$$ f**king life is going to bestow upon my being Happy new year :')",0
"is there a mobile app which is a central hub for anxiety/depression motivational videos, useful contacts and support groups? I've searched but i can't find any",0
"If I take my own life, it's all going to be about how selfish I am and how could I do this to my family and what could I have done to help. But if a drunk driver takes me out, then no more guilt. All of a sudden I was taken too soon and how tragic my death is.",0
"Worst year of my life, 2018 cant be any worse I guess ü§î",0
"Hi everyone, not sure if this belongs here but oh well. I find when I have nothing to do and just lay in bed the whole time it makes my depression worse. I tell myself staying in bed is easier than doing anything at all (e.g- meeting up with friends). I‚Äôm trying to change those ways! Was wondering what are some things people do to keep themselves busy whether they be at home or outside.",0
and I can't even do that :( It sits just out of reach. I can't force it to happen. I always feel like this.,0
I hope I die on my way to work today,0
I kinda think about it a lot more than I should but would things be the same? Would people miss me? Would people just be like whatever he's gone how would they go about life knowing they'll never see hear or talk to me again ?,0
"im so lonley this new years all my family is out and i have nothing to do alone at home im 24 years old,what kind i do to distract myself?",0
"I have had such a hard time eating lately. I will be hungry and know I NEED to eat, finally gear myself to the effort of cooking something, barely touch it, then get bored of eating and not want to anymore. Does anyone else experience this?",0
"I can either stay at home and drink wit my parents friends which will be shit or I can ride my bike about 4 hours to get to the city where my friends live. Part of that ride includes going over a fucking mountain. Plus, just took a ritalin pill so I'll be fucked after the ride.",0
"I've found that if I keep my energy up, my other depressive symptoms will go away, if they're not too severe that day. My drug of choice is Red Bull. Coffee can do the same if it's strong enough. None of this Starbucks Frappachino bullshit. Those are delicious, but do as much as water. Has anyone else found similar results from raising energy levels?",0
Have no one to spend it with every single year. My sisters are having friends over and they are just going to make fun of me for being by myself in my room playing video games. Gotta make it seem like i'm doing something tonight. How lame can someone get?,0
"and i know they all know it's today. I wished my """"""best friend"""""" of ten years a happy birthday a few days ago but clearly i misjudged how many people ever even think of me. and it isn't just this, i feel like if i never made an effort to talk to any of them they would just continue to ignore me",0
"I'm tired of wage slavery, individualism, materialism but it's all we have today",0
"I‚Äôm starting to see 2018 on tweets or images from the other side of the globe, and it‚Äôs filling me with unspeakable dread, something like I‚Äôm leaving a stove on in 2017. Like I wasted this year or I‚Äôm not ready for 2018?",0
"It's like I'm always sad because I don't know how to make myself feel better so I rely constantly on other people and since it pisses off my friends I turn to strangers on reddit, and if I'm not sad then I'm making low-effort shitposts Fuck my life xd‚Ñ¢ I'm going to read this in three years and wonder what the fuck was wrong with me at 16 But fine whatever I'll take my depression meds and get off of reddit now",0
"I grew up in a toxic environment, now that I'm older, all the trauma is coming at me like a freight train and I'm just left to deal with it. Who else's family is the main cause of their depression?",0
"well fuck me, guess i failed even at that",0
"I just don't think I can do it. What's the point of it, just because we're expected to do it? Then again if I don't do it I'm going to feel guilty. Fuck all the happy, functional families out there.",0
Yeah my plans ended up falling through cause I make poor decisions at times. So 2018 will prob be the year it happens. Just one shit storm after the other for me. Fuck man lol. Why couldn‚Äôt we just be made like robots or something?,0
"Too much. Over the past 4 years I've dealt with many suicides, overdoses and death. I'm tired and weak. It's hard to see where the light is at with ur eyes closed. God forgive me. I hope this post helps raise awareness. God bless",0
Nothibg will change. But good luck to every body,0
"You know, because people who have it sussed it go to parties and celebrate the new year whereas I re-watch a favourite movie or tv series at 11:30 so I can avoid midnight.",0
"Everything I do feels worthless and even though I try my hardest to make it all better, to distract myself, but I never feel better. Does drinking help? Will I just feel worse? What can I do? I have nothing going for me and it's all now or never. I need something to make me feel better, or I might as well just die.",0
Hey! So I‚Äôve been having a depressive episode for a few weeks now and my biggest problem has been loss of motivation. I‚Äôd really like to finish simple chores such as laundry etc. in time for New Years but I just can‚Äôt. Does anyone have any tips/advice on how I can increase my motivation during this episode? Thanks!!,0
"Went to get a massage the other day and the masseuse spent extra time on my left arm (SH scars) and since I‚Äôve had a very heavy feeling. It‚Äôs not sadness, just a heavy weird feeling. I don‚Äôt know how to explain it. Has anyone else been there? It‚Äôs lingering and I‚Äôm just uncomfortable now. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs pity or shame, just very weird. I don‚Äôt know.",0
"Just the idea of being able to leave this reality and just be drunk alone at home is comforting, not needing to care or be there. What is even more depressing is that I care about being of age to do this, and being able to just do it alone. Not to follow a cliche on this subreddit but does anyone else feel this way? Just wanting to hide away in being inebriated.",0
I don't even know what to do anymore. We moved away from family so she could finish her degree. Now with her gone I have nobody. No friends or family. I'm all alone. Now I even have to get rid of my dog. This new year is starting off terribly.,0
"I've been putting it off for a long time, because I've always questioned the validity of the field, but I think maybe it's time. Time to talk to someone who knows how to respond, and hear me blabber on my meaningless bullshit.",0
"I was looking soo foward to 2018, I was happy. Now I have nothing to look forward too.",0
It feels like 2018 will be a make or break year for me.,0
"My depression is really something. In addition of making this last 5 years of my life hell, now I don't even feel anything when an event as sad as this happens. I look like a freak not crying. And before someone says ""you are just shocked"", believe me, I wish that was true. I know for a fact that in a month, maybe less, I won't even remember.",0
"If I am unable to turn things around and make myself content, I will pull the trigger. The way I see it, if I cannot do it in a year, I will never be able to do it. I am tired of moving in circles. Either I start living, or I to on dying. I feel oddly relieved by this. Is anyone else doing something similar?",0
That sad part is that things could be worse and probably will be in 2018. Happy New Years everyone! Best of luck to everyone that's trapped in their own mind.,0
"Living is not fun anymore. Stuck in a shitty abusive relationship, always cold, nobody likes me nor do they care about me. 2017 was a shit year like the past 4 years. Please me down. I never asked to be born.",0
Nothing I do feels real. I feel like I've lost myself because I don't enjoy anything anymore. Everything I do just fills me the same feelings of saddens or anger I don't know what to do anymore. What can I do to turn the corner and get out of this state.,0
"2017 was too fast and it makes me so anxious about thinking it, i feel like a loser and it makes me wanna cry. I want to change, change for the best.... but i want to believe and wish 2018 will be a better year for everyone...i wish to everyone here happy new years for every time zone, lets all hope for a nice 2018.",0
"Advice? IÔ∏è just want her to know it‚Äôs me, and not anything she‚Äôs said or done.",0
"I feel so shitty and unworthy, and thinking about all the shit I regret from this year doesn‚Äôt help. Anyone else feels the same?",0
"Why is depression treated? Why is it not usually left well enough alone if its symptoms are seen but someone isn't a danger to others? (This goes to the extent of ""danger to self"" where things like involuntary holds and medication come in.)",0
"Feeling sad that due to my difficult pregnancy and severe post partum depression, I should not have another child. Feeling scared of getting my tubes tied because my grandmother died getting her tubes tied at my age. Feeling sad that my father won't apologize to DH so that my father could meet my 8 month daughter. Feeling sad that my father choose to keep his anger at DH instead of meeting my daughter. Feeling sad.",0
"Ugh. I so don‚Äôt have the energy for this, but 15 people (family and really REALLY close friends of mine- my support network) are coming. Doesn‚Äôt help that I am in the postdrome of a migraine. I just want to hide and cry in my room. T-1hr. 7pm. Then 5hrs of socializing. Ugh. HELP!",0
"Let me get out of the way that I'm not terribly social and avoid the bar scene like the plague, so the fact that I'm not doing something extravagant isn't what's on my mind. Basically, I'm entirely alone this year. And I've had other NYEs alone, it's whatever. But to make things worse, I'm just about as depressed as ever in terms of not wanting to do anything, escape sleeping, thinking about death, etc. It would seem like the main trigger for me at this very moment is that I was just laid off from work, and I just feel lost. I don't know how I'm paying my bills, I won't be able to go to my doctors because there goes my health insurance (guess I could apply for Medicaid idk) and just that feeling like I have no idea what I'm doing with my life. You ever go somewhere where there's other people and you envy them because they're most likely not in the least bit concerned about if life's worth living? I feel like I don't belong anywhere and there's nowhere for me to disappear to.",0
Parents ditched me again to go to their own party. No friends. No siblings. Just me and my tears. Kill me. Please.,0
Anyone tried it for Depression?,0
"It's going to be shit,I know it, you know it, we all do. Some will achieve happiness some will kill themselves. I'll just do the usual, sleep and play videogames, maybe go out to take some fresh air and then go to sleep again.",0
"As I get set to go to bed at 6pm on NYE (the first %#&amp;$ing NYE I got off from work in years and can't find any plans), I've come to realize that this year, the holidays have done nothing but make me angry. Seeing others having fun, holiday decorations, stuff that are supposed to bring joy... did nothing but piss me off.",0
"I‚Äôm sorry for posting here for what looks like the first time, but one of my family members found out my reddit username so I‚Äôm posting under a new name. I‚Äôm about an hour away from the it being 2018 and like every year, I‚Äôm alone and a little drunk. I‚Äôm trying to rationalise it by saying it‚Äôs just another night, but I‚Äôm just feeling... bleh. I feel like I‚Äôm not here, like I‚Äôm watching myself go about my day-to-day, it‚Äôs been like this for months and I‚Äôm just tired of it. I‚Äôm tired of not feeling anything and not being ‚Äúpresent‚Äù and I don‚Äôt know what to to about it. There are lots of things I could rant about but I don‚Äôt want to spam this sub with pointless ramblings, I‚Äôm just fed up.",0
That's two major holidays within 8 days. It's a bit overwhelming ...,0
I started to worry about something miniscule and an hour later I'm making it into a huge deal and it feels like the end of the world. I feel sad and angry at myself that I'm like this. I'm suppose to go hang out w a friend tonite and I'm nervous I'll be in a terrible mood around him because of this,0
Sleep is the only escape for me. How can i sleep more? Anyone got any tricks? Especially getting to sleep after you have slept already for a long time? I slept all day and i now want to sleep all night. Any ideas? I don't have any pills right now.,0
"I've had suicidal thoughts from a very young age and have never felt able to tell anybody about them because, realistically, there's no reason I should be depressed. So many people have it so much worse than I do and it makes me feel like my emotions are invalid, and that if I were to actually acknowledge them to someone else it would seem like I'm being dramatic and attention-seeking. At this point I wish I could just give my life to someone else who actually has it bad because it feels like I'm wasting it.",0
"Hi, do any of you have practical advice and methods on how to overcome fear? There are some things I have to do which, when I try to start them, cause me to have this intense freezing fear. In my case it can be opening various mail or even starting to read some book. It could even be when I decide to rent a movie. I know I shouldn‚Äôt be afraid and I do not see rational reasons for it, but I get waves of fear that feel like there is a predator that is going to attack. I feel it and I am gripped with stillness and fear as if I am hiding and can‚Äôt move or breathe heavily because it could reveal my position. Because of this I end up not doing things I have to do, missing some deadlines, not going to the dentist. Well the dentist is understandable since no one wants to go to them. In my case it is mundane things. This is probably a symptom of PTSD I am diagnosed with, but I still need to find ways to overcome these irrational fears.",0
"I‚Äôve sat in a dark room for 5 hours staring at a wall, doing nothing. Yet I still felt as bored as if I were to just watch Netflix or play games. I feel bored and scared. Scared that I lost my mind and will never be normal again.",0
hopefully this is my last new years alive so yay. i should celebrate,0
"I guess not: What's the point of having no friends,girlfriend or social life basicly... I'am only alive because of my family... I dont want to make them sad and to think that they're responsible for they're son death..I don't know man,I hope this year atlest bring some happines to me, but i've really lost my hope about everything...Anyways i wanted to share that with u guys..Have a happy new year and be blessed all &lt;3 Peace.",0
"i was going to hang out with a few people who i haven‚Äôt seen in a while and they all just said they‚Äôre doing stuff that they ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt know about‚Äù or was ‚Äúunexpected‚Äù tonight. i asked one of my friends from work what he was doing tonight, and he‚Äôs going to a few parties and gonna have a great time, and by his language i could tell he wasn‚Äôt about to invite me along or anything. i would make everyone, including myself, too uncomfortable anyway. i couldn‚Äôt stop fantasizing about all the fun shit i was gonna do for the last few days, but i guess it‚Äôs just like everything else: a fantasy.",0
"i like learning more about depression. since it helps me understand myself better. usually i watch youtube videos about it. or read about it on forums and etc. anyway i noticed that most of the time youtube comment section contains something similar to this: Billy ""i've been depressed for 1 year. i feel like shit all the time"" Chumbucket3000 ""ohh yeah. i had depression and anxiety disorder for 3 years now"" BucketChumm0003 ""yeah? try 10 years"" tiredofthinkingnames ""i was depressed since i was in my fathers balls had 100 disorders before my father was born"" and etc.. why are people like this. i mean yeah you have it bad but instead of measuring ""depression dick size"" maybe try and help one another. what im trying to say is that i think most of the comments people leave are useless on youtube. and idk why should anyone care about this post. ohh well.",0
I told him about my problems but he just left it at that. I know that only professional help is going to work but hell it's so lonely.,0
"I really miss playing ps1 games with my best friend all day, I miss not having to worry about anything. Is there any way of making this feeling stop ? (yes, I tried playing the same games I used to play but it just doesn't feels the same.)",0
I can't do anything right anymore. My girl and I have been fighting financial struggle for about 7 months now. Our cars broke down in two separate locations and even though the businesses promised they woildnt tow them they did. Now it will cost 700 to get our cars back which we dont have and cant get. We are not going to have rent and our roomates are going to kick us out. We thought things were just about to get better with both getting new jobs. But then this shit happens. I cant do it anymore and I know she can't. I'm supposed to be the one who can help her get through tough times but I'm losing the fight inside of me. I just want to die. I really do.,0
"Every ""day"" is the fucking same. Wake up, shower, eat, then sit around until I can fucking sleep. This is a never ending cycle of hell. I don't even keep track of the date anymore, it's just more so light and darkness now.",0
"I just want to be myself again.I am full of anger,sadness,hate...can't escape.I am about to lost any trace of hope inside me.I can't take it anymore.I hate everyone for their happyness...I just want them to feel my pain.What the fuck we did to deserve this destoyed lives...I feel so lost,tired,empty...alone.How do you survive ?",0
"I loved you at the beginning 2017. You took me for a hell of a ride. I began to hate you more and more as each month went on. You brought to me so much sadness and suffering, at times I just wanted it to end. As much as this year took a turn for the worse I want to thank you. Thank you for the hardships you threw at me. 2017 made me stronger and wanting to anticipate 2018. I can happily say that I am no longer depressed. Just more eager to see what‚Äôs to come. Here‚Äôs to another year on this planet üéâüéâ.",0
"A little rant. This year has been the same as far as I can remember, feeling sad, angry, sick, but overall, tired. No valid reason for that. Failing at college because the lack of motivation/anxiety, but mainly because I can't force myself to do anything more than be there. Love life... Well, don't even want to talk about that, I just suck at this, don't even need to be ugly when you are just... Not an interesting person who also tends to be clingy. Another year goes by and the rock goes downhill once more.",0
"Just a thought I have sometimes. I'm not getting into the ""who would care if I die"" discussion. I just mean in actuality, who would discover I had died? I don't live with anyone and I don't have visitors soooo",0
"I've been on and off depression for my entire life, sometimes it can be triggered by a traumatic event, but in most cases it just happens. I have friends, I have a good job, I have a roof over my head, and I have hobbies that make me happy. However, I still go through episodes of just feeling completely alone, sad, and suicidal. I'm at the point where I've just accepted it and try to roll with it until it goes away for a few days and I can feel somewhat normal. But unfortunately, none of my family or friends can really understand it. They get angry at me for being depressed or spending days locked in my room. I tell them that I can't control it, but they always say I'm just acting out. Like no, fuck off Debra why would anyone want to act like they're depressed? I just want people to understand that depression can just happen, for no reason, and that's ok.",0
I know everyone is going through their own struggles right now and some who lost hope in most things but i wish that this year might bring happiness to at least some of you. Happy new year guys :),0
"New year‚Äôs coming around and IÔ∏è really just want to say thank you to all of you. IÔ∏è still have a long way to go, but reading posts on here and getting feedback from real people has helped much more than anyone can think. I‚Äôve been to multiple therapists but none of them have been as helpful as this. We‚Äôre all so broken but have so much care within us. It makes me so happy to see us all try to put each other back together even at our lowest of times. Once again, IÔ∏è really do thank you guys, a bunch of strangers caring when you don‚Äôt have to; and IÔ∏è hope 2018 is a better year than 2017 for all of us.",0
I look for you everywhere I look for you in everyone I never thought two years Could feel this long,0
To not be alive by the end of January.,0
"Hiya redditors of r/depression, as a person who suffers from depression and social anxiety, I know what it‚Äôs like to feel lonely, particularly on big holidays like these. If anyone is feeling down or lonely or depressed feel free to PM me! Nobody deserves to be depressed, especially on a holiday that‚Äôs supposed to be happy and hopeful. I welcome any and all messages (if you need to rant, or just talk, etc.) Have a wonderful NYE everybody! (Post inspired by a similar post on r/socialanxiety)",0
I need help someone help me please,0
"I have no money for a therapist, but I want to end all of this. I spend my days crying and listening to music, and I don't want to be like this forever. Please share your experiences.",0
"Hi... I'm 19 y.o., today around 23:00 I had a big fight with my mother, I made joke about her loud chewing and she flipped out...I walked away to my room and had anxiety attack while I listened to her crying in another room.... At midnight when we drinked champagne she didn't even looked me in the eye... Now I'm sitting in my room crying and listening how she wants to throw me out of the house, how she is screaming at my father... I just see one way out... I did nothing wrong, I didn't ment it wrong... I don't understand how it could turn into this... So I guess happy new year... I hope it's gonna be the last one....",0
I've felt like a social outcast for as long as I can remember. I've always felt like everyone else is constantly running around going to parties and hanging out with each other. [This article](https://www.bustle.com/p/how-social-media-fomo-affects-your-wellbeing-7510145) that showed up on the front page helps me feel a lot better. Maybe I'm not actually a social outcast. Maybe you're not either.,0
This is the saddest New Years of my life. Spending it completely sober and alone. Hopefully i feel lots of baby kicks tonight to cheer me up a bit. I‚Äôm hoping everyone out there stays safe and enjoys whatever they‚Äôre doing to bring in the new year. Cheers mates.,0
"Over the past few years, health and ED fucked up sex life to point wife wont even try anymore. Past year she has become an online gaming addict and you have to drag her away from the machine. We spend less time together now than I spend taking care of my own needs. Havent had sex in 3 years. Wife constantly answer anything I ask with extremely contemptuous tone. Daughter who is very bright is on the way to failing out of school and keeps falling for online guys 7-20 years older than her. My job has the potential to dry up next year and I have no savings. I am nearing 50 and work in IT but my skill set has atrophied over the years because they only let me work on so few things. We have 5 pets that no one else in the house cares for anymore. I do all the housework. I work. I live paycheck to paycheck. My family is worthless. My 1990's era car is on its last legs. I just cant find a wya to give a fuck about anything anymore.",0
...and you know what I'm going to do this year? I'm going to get myself the help I want and need. I will improve my life. That's my mission for this year. Got a doctor's appointment for dysthymia later this month. Let's sort this shit out.,0
"Well i just celebrated new yrs eve with my family. With my parent's that will get divorced soon. With my mother that cheated on my father. With younger siblings who have no clue what's happening.

"Graduated from a shitty uni with shitty degree to a shitty job market so I've been jobless for the whole year, relatives makes fun of my unemployment, ended up obese from my dependency on food as an emotional comfort, contemplating suicide a few times from all this. I used to be one of the happiest people around and now I seclude myself all day only finding whatever joy i have left in my hobbies. I want get better, I want to exercise, I want to socialise and just have fun, but I couldn't get past all the crushing shitty reality I found myself in and wonder if its worth it.

"Why is it the two worst, most hurtful relationships lasted years, while the ones that feel that they have the most love and promise a real future fall apart in an eye blink. I feel cursed to either live in misery, or except fleeting happiness, followed by loneliness. What a joke. I really fucking hate my life.",0
"I just want to sleep all the time because if I'm sleeping, I'm not hurting. I'm too young to drink legally and I don't currently have a fake so I can't really self-medicate with alcohol too frequently. I'm about to go on a higher dose of meds which will hopefully numb me out more. Lately my main way has been escaping all negative thoughts through sleeping or video games. Maybe going back to college in a few weeks will help me? Idk. I want some suggestions for dealing with pain",0
"I know a lot have been discussed about SSRI and their potential sexual side effects. For the last 6 months I have been on Fluoxetine and Duloxetine (my shrink thinks that my depression is a result of bad things that happened to me and was planning to wean and stop them within 1 year). However, I had to take a drug screen for work and I read that Fluoxetine can give a false positive result in the UDS and I didn't want to tell my potential employer that and take anti - depressants for the fear of stigmatizing. Anyway, I stopped both SSRIs 1 week before the test (now is 10 days without them) and I don't feel any different, in fact if anything, I feel happier, but the most striking was my marked increase in my libido and the capability to ejaculate once again :) When I was on the SSRIs I had turned into an asexual creature and if I ""force"" my self to have sex or watch porn I had a half - @ass erection and (kind of whiskey d!ck) and more often than not I had to fake and orgasm (using a condom) or if by any chance I can finish is after a long ""banging"" and with an almost painful spasms of my legs, really weird sense. Now I feel like I am a 30 yr old (I am mid - 40s) - have a ""morning wood"", I regained my interest in sex, I am able to ejaculate, etc. I am nervous to start the meds again, but don't want to go back to the deep depression that I was before in case they had any effect. Cheers and Happy New Year and success in the sack :)",0
"I graduated college this year and thought for sure by now id at least have a start date for a new career. in fact, my temp job laid me off and before then they were cutting my hours.

For the first time in awhile the suicidal thoughts have resurfaced. Anyway, i just wanted to get that out.",0
"hello this is my first post i have been having a bad time with my depression as i feel like its ruining my life i am i a quiet person who doesn't like going out but my parents are always trying to get me outside which is fine but when i say no they always get annoyed with me and then start guilt tripping me and then it makes me feel terrible and doesn't help with my depression they know i'm sensitive but they do this to me all the time and i can't take it any more. i have no clue what to do when this happens it makes me feel terrible and all i want to do is curl up and cry but they just never understand i recently was harassed into going and yelled at my mum about how she did it to me but all i got was told off for yelling at her. they know i don't like going out yet they keep going on with it and if i refuse they punish me and to make matters worse my little brother copies me (he is only 12 i'm 16) then i don't know what to do anymore. should i talk to them or just avoid them when possible. i have been having problems with my parents for awhile as they always do something to affect my depression like putting me down every time i say im going to improve something about my life like i'm going to go out more then i get a response like this ""well you have to go out first to do that"" which makes me feel useless. i have been suicidal in the past and this consent nagging and putting me down has affected that.",0
"So here I am again, at another new years celebration time after 2017 flew by. I just can't do this life thing anymore, its so stupid and pointless, I just don't care anymore, I wouldn't be losing much being dead. I have nothing to live for, and I am a loser. Im sick and tired of this life, and I just want to move on. I am due to turn 21 now, and you know what, TO HELL WITH THAT! Id like to die now, as a young person. I don't want to live into the future, I don't want to grow old, the way I see it, things are all getting progressively worse, and I feel like the future will be miserable. There is no point in continuing anymore. I don't like myself, I don't like what I see in the mirror, I don't like the time I was born into, I don't like my situation, I don't like my own personality, Everything about myself and my life I HATE THIS WORLD, I don't want to continue to be a part of it. It is extremely unfair, and horrifically materialistic. There just isn't any point, Its over. So maybe i'll get out my old power saw and slash myself open. Thats how I should die. The death of a person filled with self hatred, should die in the most brutal way possible.",1

Yup. Everyone is out getting drunk and being reckless (like every other 19 year old). Here I am in a empty parking garage eating McDonald's because my parents forgot to save me some dinner. I hate my life.,0

Now I'm stuck in my room just sad and depressed. I am 21 though, so I'm wondering if I should just go to the bar and drink a bit so at least I'm surrounded by people when the new year starts. I'm hopeful for the future, but rn I'm down as hell. I try to look my best all the time but my nerdy demeanor and social anxiety kills any interest someone might have towards me. Idk what to do.",0

"It's like a deep feeling that I'm just gonna ruin everything all over again. and that everyone will just leave me behind because of me. It's only 11:14AM since I tried sleeping in to skip the day, and then sleep for longer at nighttime. It's like a collection of suicidal thoughts and anxieties only over one year. I felt as if I was unable to make a New Years resolution because of it. I'm too hopeless to even make one. I feel like a mess. I want to die. My depression just wont go away, no matter what I do each year, it's just there.",1
"So, long time lurker here. Pretty sure no one will respond. First off, Happy New Year's to everyone. As for me, I'm spending it alone in a NYC apartment that doesn't belong to me. Don't ask. Anyways, I've been dealing with depression for a long time. First got diagnosed with it my senior year of high school. That was also the year I got suspended for drug use (I attended a boarding school), and subsequently got waitlisted at 5 top 20 schools that I would have got into if it hadn't been for my suspension. I hate myself for it. Just finished my first semester at a random, no-name college and it was pathetic. While I work two jobs, I isolated myself, and as a result, practically have no friends left. Always wondering what would of happened if I laid off the drugs in high school and got into a decent college.",1
"EDIT: I was in a bad mood, mostly frustrated as the songs I made in the period of 2 weeks I was created hadn't struck a chord with me, but since the responses i've gotten i've since got a new perspective on it.

"That have never had a fun New Years? No one invites me to anything and it just feels fucking horrible. I asks people if they're doing anything and I just get a ""Idk"" and then on new years I see that they're on a cool party or something that seems nice. Here I am with my pc and suicidal thoughts listening to my parents fucking party that drives me nuts. Every year it's the same fucking thing. Fuck new years",0

I don't really know how to deal with this. I'll stay alive, I'll get through life, finish college on full scholarship. But I don't think I'll be happy. It's sad, I don't even want to drink.

"I have been taking Sertraline for 9 months and was on max dosage and after 3 months everything got better. My mindset changed and I looked back at myself and couldn‚Äôt believe the thoughts I had and was scared how bad I was. Thinking I was fine, I reduce my dosage and I‚Äôve stop taking them but the withdrawals are not what I expected. I read about others but I didn‚Äôt truly understand how intense they are, my mindset is going back to what is was, I slept 2 hours maximum a night, I have constant brain zaps, sweats. I haven‚Äôt gone back on the antidepressant yet because I‚Äôve gone a week without them but I was wondering if I should hold this out? Will it get worse and how long do I have. I didn‚Äôt have a problem taking the meds but (and I know this sounds bad) but in my own mind they were a crutch. When I felt better I just wanted to leave that part of my life behind and remembering to take them pulls me back into that headspace Is the negative thoughts and anxiety part of the withdrawal symptoms or is it me slipping back into my old way of thinking",0
"I feel lonely because it's another NYE and it just reminds me that I've gone another year without finding anyone to connect with, share life with. Nobody to share stupid resolutions that we'll break with. Nobody to say ""happy New years!"" at midnight to. I feel like 2018 is just going to be another repeat of work, school, sleep, eat, again... and that I won't make any meaningful connection with anyone, won't achieve my goal of completing a degree, and it won't be any different from the last 5 years. I realize that this is probably part of my depression kicking in, but I'm really sad I haven't even got a friend to chat with tonight.",0
"Feeling pretty lonely, lately I have been having anxiety attacks and I‚Äôm pretty sure have officially slumped into depression. Didn‚Äôt think I would ever get depressed. It feels like nobody cares anymore. I wanted to be with my GF for New Year‚Äôs Eve, and she doesn‚Äôt want to. So now I‚Äôm just in the basement, wanting to cry and burst into tears but just doesn‚Äôt seem to want to happen. I feel so alone, I‚Äôve tried to keep my mind clear by playing video games, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to work. I‚Äôm running out of options. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I just need somebody to hug me and tell me everything is going to be alright. I feel so helpless right now...",0
"And no, the big rock doesn't fucking break the chest ending my disgusting endless painful life, it stays there laughing at me when I'm crying.",0
But not because I was sad but because I was so happy. I‚Äôm spending some days with friends in a bigger city and we were planning on going to a prayer at 11 pm and then to a party. But I am crazily scared of fireworks (childhood trauma here you go) so I decided last minute to stay at our accommodation. A few minutes later 3 friends decided to come back because they were worried and didn‚Äôt want me to spend New Year‚Äôs Eve alone. I resisted in the beginning but they made they‚Äôre decision and stayed with me. We had a small prayer and Christmas cookies and just spend some beautiful hours together. Afterwards they said it was the most beautiful New Year‚Äôs Eve they‚Äôve ever had and same applies to me because I‚Äôm used to spending it alone and having a breakdown. I am just so happy and it‚Äôs unbelievable for me someone actually cared about me. However my ex roommate texted me as well how much she enjoyed being my roommate and how much I taught her. These things are so important for me right now because I realized I‚Äôm really deep in my depression again and struggling with my current situation. I didn‚Äôt think I meant anything to anyone and I was just being there but all of this showed me that there are people that care. And there are also people out there that care about you. You might not think they do or find it completely unbelievable but there are people that care and that would miss you if you‚Äôd just be gone. Take care.,0
"Anyone else spending the night alone? I'm just gonna fry me up some pork chops, smoke some bud, and play video games. No one to hang out with and I've already been hit by one drunk driver so bars are a no go. O well fuck it! Right?",0
"Ive recently had the alpha stim bought for me by a parent. Its a device which clips electrical nodes to your head, stimulating the brain to activate parts of it which may be inactive or overactive due to depression. Been using it a couple of months now and have improved greatly. I can slip back into depressive thoughts but its not as constant as before. Was just wondering if anyone else has used the alpha stim and if they have did longer use of it eradicate their depression completely?",0
Curious as to this? I get in a bitter angry mood and come here. Then I see everyone else suffering the same thing and I get even more bitter and angry. Almost like kindling to an already burning fire.,0

I locked the door and layed out the pictures which included pictures of my mom when she was young me as a kid my dad and my siblings.

I grab them open them and then i turn the cup upside down which resulted the pills touching my mouth. Then it came to me. The thought of everything and i quickly close them back wipe my tears and decide to stay alive. I dont know if this was a suicide attempt but i thought inshould share this here.

I can be sad but it doesn't last long before I force myself to feel happy again. I can control it. I can control my happiness. I force myself to laugh and have fun and I feel the dopamine rush. Deep down, however, I feel like in the long run it doesn't mean anything. I don't know what the goal of life is but it's not to be happy. Not for me at least. I would love to feel empathy again. I miss it. No matter how hard I try, I can't feel it. It's like I have become immune to it. I have one male friend who knows everything about me. I believe I'm not homosexual but I think about him a lot recently. It feels like he is someone who I would be able to feel affection towards. Even this would be better than nothing, I suppose.

"This past year has been amazing in terms of working on my mental illness. The past month or so (Holidays are the worst for me since I don't talk to my family.) I've been really going up and down. I have bipolar disorder, PTSD and anxiety in addition to my depression. The other voice in my head is back. It keeps telling me horrible things.. I logically understand that this is just a downtime for me and that it'll pass eventually, even if it takes weeks; but I feel like I'm so tired. I'm tired of fighting with myself. I hate this world we live in, my two best friends are only great for shallow socializing. They don't understand my diseases and I just isolate myself for weeks at a time because I have no one to turn too. My roommate is fantastic, he's always been there for me but I can see how much it wears him down. I'm tired of being a burden. I've always pushed people away and I really just want to disappear. I don't want to exist anymore. I'm just so so so so so exhausted of fighting my illnesses. I'm tired of constantly fighting an uphill battle. I think it might be time for me to leave this world, if not now then soon. I think what really, really makes me angry is that I know I'm acting irrationally, it's like the real me is forever trapped inside a glass, sound-proof box screaming that it'll be okay and watching myself lash out in anger. I'm watching myself isolate myself from the people I care about and I can't do anything about it. It's like watching my own demise, like watching myself drive off a cliff.

"This year especially. I joined a D&amp;D group this year trying to make friends but they all don't like me or idk because none of them want to be friends. Anyways, they've been texting each other in our group chat (which we have when we need to ask questions like find out if everyone is good to play on our set days) for the past few days about having a New Years party. Everyone but one person said they'd be up for it (the one person was busy)...but they never asked me. They asked everyone else. Never mentioned me, asked how I was, if I could make it, if I wanted to come...nothing. Party is tonight. Early this morning (like 1-2 am), I get a text from the DM asking about my back (I threw it out a while ago and have been in constant pain), I was thinking ""oh ok this is where he asks if I'm coming.""...yeah no. Just asked about my back, I said it was slightly better since I've been resting and he said something like ""Oh that's good.""...that's it. And still no one asking about me in the main chat. It hurts being excluded like that. I can only assume they did it because I don't drive, thus I can't really get to said party or get back home without someone else driving me...but they could at least offer or ask why I've been quiet or anything! It's the thought that counts...just them thinking about me would have made it easier. This is just cruel. I'm not looking forward to our next game when I have to be around them...",0

Today is the last day of the year and this morning the scale showed that I've gained exactly 10kg! I also know that almost all of it is muscle mass, so this is the fittest I've ever been. I just wanted to share this here because I actually felt really good about this, which is a feeling I very rarely experience nowadays.

My family constantly make jokes about me and say that I look retarded and ugly, etc. And I honestly just make jokes about it but it really effects me. I guess I just need to talk to someone as I've reached another new low. My friends don't really talk to me too much anymore, but give me confidence at the same time. I just feel so ugly as I can't even take a picture and look good, and I feel really ugly especially from the side. My nose is large and sticks out and my ears are ugly but hey I'm greatful still. I'm 5 ft 11 and weigh 135lb which is pretty light and I've been working out for about a month but stopped for the past week. I guess I'm just looking for advice from people who have been through the same. I just feel like I may never be accepted. Thanks for reading and any helpful replies, Thanks guys!",1

And I still wanna die. Tonight was suppose to be something and it‚Äôs not. I had shit lined up and it didn‚Äôt pan out. I don‚Äôt get wins out here. 2018 the last,0
I‚Äôm just another one of those people who are miserable as fuck on New Years no big deal. Whatever I was alone all of 2017 so it won‚Äôt make a difference if it‚Äôs another year. Another year of pain and shit incoming.,0
"I'm severely depressed but not suicidal. I feel disconnected from almost everyone and everything. I know what needs to be done to change things but have no motivation to do so. There are times where I'm so down I just want to cry. I keep being told I'm a great guy, a good person, that I'm loved. Therapy, getting a pet, becoming a foster parent, and online dating have all been suggested today from my work spouse and one of my best friends. I tried a med change this month but it made things worse. I feel left behind, that I'm not living the life I should. Also told I don't give myself enough credit. Here's the thing, depressed and intelligent people are very in tune with their thought processes. I know I'm not terribly smart but I have eyes. I give myself exactly as much credit as I deserve and have very little to offer. Yes I have good qualities but they're dwarfed when compared to what others have to offer. Am I really being too hard on myself or am I onto something here about being beneath everything and everyone?",0
"I had a failed suicide attempt on Christmas, and since then, I‚Äôve been ‚Äúglad‚Äù to be alive but so violently depressed My birthday, the 26th, was spent working and alone. Nobody remembered it, as always. My New Years is also going to be spent alone. I‚Äôm out of my anxiety meds, and have to wait until January to get more. I want to cry all the time. Even trying to get myself to wash my hair is hard. I can‚Äôt even do that most of the time. I can only sit here wishing I was crying, but nothing is coming out. It‚Äôs just tough right now guys. I haven‚Äôt had interaction with anyone other than coworkers, and my parents for weeks. My mother, who I take care of, doesn‚Äôt believe depression is even crippling. She takes it as a stunned toe, ‚Äújust walk it off‚Äù. I‚Äôm ready to feel normal again. I‚Äôm tired of wanting any kind of attention just to feel loved for even a split second. I feel so absolutely useless in this world, but I‚Äôm too exhausted to want to kill myself again. It‚Äôs more of a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad to be alive I guess but if something killed me right now I would be okay‚Äù My life is a mess",0
"i dont know if im trying to convince myself im depressed for attention and to feel sorry for myself or not. i mean, its pretty easy to convince yourself you want to kill yourself, and go through the motions of self harming and shit, like everything in my life is my fault so i have nothing to feel depressed about right? ughh this is fucking with my head do any of you guys have experience with this",0
Parents divorcing. Grandparents died some time ago. College going shit. Feeling depressed and sad all the time and when i'm talking to my friends about it they seem to ignore it and talk about something else. Please give me one reason not to end it all... :/,0
"Last year at this time, I was working in tech support being yelled at by people I don't know. This year, I have a terminally ill family member and I'm struggling to find a place to live as I'm being kicked out of my old place. This is compounded by the fact that the city I work in has no available apartments at the start of Jan/Feb. The next closest city is about 100km away (an 1 hour+ drive). I've no idea what to do anymore. Every day I wake up feeling sicker and sicker, my head is just full of clouds, I can't find my knife that I usually use to relieve the pressure (I suspect one of my friends stole it once they realized what it was for). I'd ask for a hug, but I'm terrified of contact with people and it would just make me feel worse. It feels like there's a noise in my head that's just getting louder and louder, like someone turning up the volume on a TV station that's nothing but static. People keep telling me how impressed they are by how smart I am, but I only look smart compared to those who don't actively reject everything that's supposed to make them feel like a person. Academic medals mean nothing to someone who isn't human. TL;DR: I'm an empty shell and cracks are forming along the hull.",0
2017 was such a traumatizing and hard year for me that I can rest assured that 2018 won't be as bad (I hope).,0
"I hate being alone. I hate being single. It hurts so much.. Just been moping in front of my computer doing nothing for the past hour or so. God, why does life suck..",0
2017 has been such a shitty year for me and i hope 2018 treats me well. i‚Äôm so tired of being depressed all the time but i can‚Äôt help how i feel and it‚Äôs such a pain to see it affect my everyday lives. i‚Äôve grown distant with my friends and i‚Äôm going to try to not do that anymore because i value them so so much. i‚Äôm going to do my best to change for the better because my personality is just...pushing people away from my life and it‚Äôs sad to notice it. here‚Äôs to 2018. i hope you all have a wonderful new year‚Äôs.,0
I was having a good time hanging at home with my parents. .. and now... nothing... all I can think of doing is cutting myself.. wtf is wrong with me.,0
It will all be over in one hour when society ends the season of expecting everyone to be fake joyous. FU society!,0
"Not sure how to word this, I‚Äôm never really content with where I am. My insecurities always resurface and force me to over analyze myself when I‚Äôm with people I want to be cool with or whatever. Does anyone else ever get that voice in the back of there head saying that you are not enough? How do you personally combat these things? I used to think this kind of depression was an exaggeration but when it hit me I was like shit. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I feel hopeless when I‚Äôm by myself when in fact I know there is hope.",1
Anyone down to chat on discord?,0
"Hi everyone. I just wanted to clear something up. Two months ago, my mild symptoms had started and progressively got worse. About a month ago, I was moderately depressed but a video triggered what I thought was euphoria in me. I have experienced moderate anxiety episodes before. At first, it didn't feel like it, I felt realllly good, but then I thought, ""I haven't felt like this, my heart is racing, this must be anxiety"" and then it changed to another anxiety episode. I think it lasted for an hour and a half. So, my question is, has anyone experienced this euphoria along with depression? I'm consulting a psychiatrist, but I feel guilty about calling her up all the time.",0

I have shut down my Snapchat and instagram accounts so I don't see shit that will bring me down even more. Being lonely sucks but this has seemed to slightly help. Anyone else have trouble comparing themselves on social media? Stay well people.,0
This year has been a shitty month after shitty month. I broke down in front of 200 people and nobody could get me to calm down for 30 minutes. My last friend moved all the away across the goddamn country and my family thinks I'm a loser and embarrassment. While everyone else is having fun I'm listening to fucking spotify with my pet bird who hates my guts. Why the fuck did God create me? To torture me? Idk anymore I just want to end it. I hate everything and everyone. Fuck this world.,0
"Halloween is bad because you get to see how much of a loser you are and how lonely you are. You get watch all night in agony, the stories and post of others having fun that you will literally never experience. Birthdays are bad because no one cares enough to remember. Not as lonely necessarily, but disappointing. You are a certain age, you should have certain experiences and skill, but you don‚Äôt. You should have accomplished something in an entire year, right? No, you are a worthless and pathetic waste of energy. Someone should really kill me, because all I am is a waste. Tonight I get the suffering of both those holiday is one night. I spent a whole week without crying, I spend almost 2 weeks without cutting. That‚Äôs gone now. I really really wanna just end it. I have the note in the desk drawer. Either way, lots of my blood and tears will be shed tonight. Happy New Years",1
I am so fucking depressed it‚Äôs like everybody around me gets their shit together everybody eventually seems to get what they want except from me I seem to lose everything that makes me happy I am 22 never had a girlfriend all I ever had gotten from a girl was a kiss and then she dumped me! I hate my life and I can‚Äôt find a job either to have my own apartment I live with my aunt and uncle and hate every second of it I wanna get out and I can‚Äôt afford it I don‚Äôt know what to do I don‚Äôt believe in miracles anymore!,0
"That is one of my rare social outings. I am in my 40's and have social anxiety among other things. Never been in a relationship. I don't go out of the house much except for my work and running my needed errands. Prefer being at home but also wish I had the desire to go out and enjoy myself. I mostly live a lonely unfulfilling existence. Hate New Years, hate birthdays. Hate anything that makes me realize time is moving forward and I am not.",0
Here‚Äôs to hoping this is the year IÔ∏è finally have the guts to kill myself and end all of this,0
"I wanted to make this year a great one, but that won't happen. I'm in a household where every time i try to better myself, someone or something ruins it. I've gotten very bad anxiety/depression the last few weeks but if i try to talk to my family about it they either make it a competition or write it off. I want to get better at drawing but i can't draw for a half hour for what i get interrupted. And i want to draw for three hours each day but that won't happen. I'm wanting to lose weight but my family lives off of fast food and snacks. I want to do so much, but then my depressing thoughts of death and horrible memories catch up with me and i realize my reality is shit. The only thing keeping me here is the idea of getting away and being happy. I feel so lonely, lost, scared and confused. There's so much dwelling in me right now and this is just 1% of it.",0
Nothing fuckin changes... I am alone. I will always be alone in this world.,0
\*glasses clink* Cheers! ~_^ Happy new year.,0
"I know tonight is supposed to be a good one but I'm having a hard time shaking the thoughts of just pulling the plug. The thought of going through yet another year in poverty, loneliness, hatred and sadness is almost too much for me to bear. I'm 23 years old, I've never had a girlfriend, I've barely had any sex to speak of, I work minimum wage shitty jobs, I have no friends, no family to speak of, and no young woman even close to my age seems to want anything to do with me. I get degraded by other men for not having had enough sex, not seeming masculine enough, and while I understand men are supposed to be strong, few people understand that men have feelings too. It's like my life is some nightmare I can't wake up from. I look young for my age, and while I've been through so much and so many difficult experiences, people only see an 18 year old kid when they look at me. Girls assume I am naive and immature and look the other way, guys assume I'm a pussy. I get nothing, because apparently I am nothing, at least to the naked eye. My parents are both 61 and may die before I even find happiness in my life. But honestly I want to die first.",0
"Not a day goes by that I don‚Äôt think about when my mom tried to end it back in March. Luckily I still have, her, my best friend. I have depression too though. I actually enjoy sitting in the bar alone, but when I leave I wallow in self pity. I love my job and have a great life but still feel dull. I‚Äôm content being single but long to experience someone. The cold seems to make the sadness worse. Here‚Äôs to a mindfully warmer 2018.",0
"As my depression has only gotten worse and worse over time, this is quite obviously the worst New Years I‚Äôve ever had. I‚Äôm here, laying in bed, browsing this sub while occasionally checking Snapchat to see all of my friends out having the time of their lives. I was invited to a few parties, but it‚Äôs wishful thinking to imagine myself having gone to any of them. So here I am, in this shithole apartment, with my mother sleeping in the bed next to mine so I can‚Äôt even get up to have a smoke without waking her. I‚Äôm only 17, I should be out having fun, meeting people, experiencing my youth, but my depression and anxiety are so bad I could hardly muster up the courage to even set foot outside. I can‚Äôt believe this is how I ended up. I know I know, I‚Äôm still young, I haven‚Äôt quite ‚Äúended up‚Äù anywhere yet, but I‚Äôve more or less made up my mind that suicide is the end goal. And with how bad my depression is getting, it‚Äôs gonna happen sooner rather than later. Anyway, Happy New Year. I hope 2018 won‚Äôt be as rotten as 2017 was but odds are I won‚Äôt make it halfway through before knotting up a rope and hanging myself.",0
"Hey guys, I'm at a New Years party and I'm in non formalware. If there is anyone else who is isolated in their piece of the room, wilt thou like to talk to me?",0
"Not only was it cringe inducing being forced to watch it. Seeing all the people kissing their loved ones, people partying, etc. Fuck the new year.",0
"I've had about three interviews and a couple phone interviews and nothing yet. I know it's the holidays and no one is hiring en masse yet. But, God, sitting around the house sucks. I miss just buying things without having to do quick mental math to see if I could afford it. I intend on joining the plumbers union, but God help me if I don't get in.",0
"I‚Äôm just done at this point. I have to work New Years at my busy ass restaurant and half my staff call out, very thing that can go wrong at work is, my family and friends are all celebrating and enjoying themselves, and I know I might lose my manager position because I can‚Äôt get other my anxiety and stress. And the one person, my best friend, who i can turn to and try to feel assurance that my fucked up life isn‚Äôt a waste, is on lockdown with her parents. No phone, no internet, no contact with the outside world. I was supposed to spend I.t with her at work at least but now I‚Äôm outside, crying my eyes out and wondering if I should just slit my wrist after work.... 2017 was the worst year for me and I don‚Äôt want to see 2018.... fuck idk why I‚Äôm posting this but I‚Äôm feel so tired and worn and broken. I‚Äôm sorry.",0
This year was hell to me and every year before was too. This year I lost 4 pets including one last week and my group of friends turned on me and set out to ruin my life. Hopefully something happens to make this year better but I doubt it. I also hope Kim Jong Un‚Äôs fat ass and his family gets assassinated so he can‚Äôt kill us first,0
"Read the title... I was already dealing with a depressive episode and now this shit. Guys n girls, I think it's time for me to pass on to the next life/afterlife/darkness/otherside, or whatever you wanna call it. Keep living on for me. Happy new year! See you whenever.",0
"My friends making me create this routine so i get over the d. I'm not excited at all.

I tried to kill myself multiple times since 2015 And I haven't been successful. Oh well... Another year to suffer through this hell,0
"I've been having suicidal thoughts a lot more than usual. I've been sleeping more and waking up later than I have been for the last few months. I've been a bit down for a while and I don't know what to do. I'm beyond help, I dont want to go to a therapist. I have no friends to tell this who would take this seriously. I've failed 3 of my classes. I don't know what to do. Please help. I'm so lonely. Please help me.",0
Just had a close friend completely block me and as the title suggests he was a furry. He recently came out as a furry and I was fine with it but recently he started hanging out with his furry friends and just up and blocked me today. One of his new friends might be a pedophile anyways and they were talking about meeting up to go to a con but you know what screw him. So yes I am now depressed as he was my only friend.,0
"damn, at least some fcking alcohol would have made this shitty, depressing-ass night a little easier. that's what everyone else is doing anyway, getting black-out drunk. but instead, in all my sober consciousness, i got to watch a bunch of happy excited people with bright eyes out in times square kissing each other and doing anything at all in their lives at midnight tonight.",0
"I feel so alone. I‚Äôve wasted my teenage years. Never been kissed, never gone to a party, drank, or any other milestones that are supposed to make your teenage years something you‚Äôll look back on fondly forever. Here‚Äôs hoping for a new year, new me. Cheers",0
1 month ago I was considering suicide. I talked to my primary care physician and told them how I was feeling and what I was thinking. They put me into a group therapy program and I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. I can honestly say it saved my life. I cannot express how helpful this was for me and I urge you all to talk to someone. There is hope for us all and people willing to listen. It‚Äôs the new year and the perfect time for a change.,0
"I‚Äôm 17 and my mental health is at an all time low. I think about killing myself every day, but I never go through with it because of my parents, whom I love very much. The thing is, my grades have gone from As to Ds and Fs. I can‚Äôt bring myself to do anything. I keep asking for extensions but not fulfilling them. I have no friends and I spend everyday sleeping. After a 6 year battle with depression, I want it all to be over. I‚Äôm either killing myself, or I‚Äôm fixing this by going to a mental hospital. Do I need my parents‚Äô consent to be admitted? How long do you usually stay? And what has your experience been?",0
"shits been rough for a long long time, but 2017 was better for me in a lot of ways. I think 2018 might finally be the year I get out of this hole and start enjoying life here's to hoping, at least",0
"So just sent everyone a New Year snaps, they opened it and no one has wished me back. Sums 2017 &amp; a great start to 2018. Here's to another depressing year!",0
"I‚Äôm one of you, and if no one else has said it to you, I hope you have a great 2018. Depression is a bitch, but hopefully this year brings you something good. Here‚Äôs to a (hopefully) happy 2018. If you are sad right now, that doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs no hope at all for you this year. The start of the new year always depresses me because I feel like I should be doing something to celebrate and I‚Äôm not. But I‚Äôm trying to accept that as okay. Happy New Year, everyone.",0
"A big wave of sadness just hit me like a ton of bricks and I don't even know why, I think I'm just gonna cry this on out. I don't know what to do.",0
That's it. There's nothing else to it. People just don't want me around I guess.,0
"21. I have several autoimmune disorders (lupus is the main) and have a hard time keeping on weight. I‚Äôm in a lot of pain. I‚Äôm also lonely because I don‚Äôt have any friends except for my fianc√©, but family isn‚Äôt around. I work full time as a valet and go to school full time. Tonight I got hypothermia and frostbite on my left foot at work because I don‚Äôt want to admit I have inabilities in the cold because of the lupus (I have neuropathy and vascular issues). I‚Äôm in so much pain tonight and don‚Äôt know what to do. I hate being in so much pain. I just don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to about this and don‚Äôt want to introduce it to anyone. It hurts me as well as others.",0
I've been emotionally unstable since last night and have been unstable all day. It got to me at around 6 and I've been feeling like shit since. Just so lonely and shitty right now :(,0
"I just want to cry, all I want is a damn cry, I cant cry, nothing will come out, im full of pressure that wont release, I wouldnt mind passing peacefully in my sleep tonight",0
"I'm laying in bed and thinking about what a fucked up year I've had. Seriously, what a fucking shit show. Years of depression and other mental illnesses finally caught up to me. Like it beat the shit out of me. I put an end to something fucked up that I did but the damage is still there and not completely cleared because I don't know how to approach the situation because I'm fucking mentally fucked up and I don't even know how to explain that to someone. I spent days in bed, crying, paranoid walking around outside thinking people know all my secrets and all thats wrong with me. I've spent days being yelled at by my parent, being a second parent to my little sibling and still being told that I do nothing. That I don't give. Being emotionally and verbally abused by my sister. Letting guilt numb me till I can't feel anymore. Hating myself on top of hating myself, to the point where I want to rip myself apart whenever I see my reflection. 21 years and I have no fucking friends. I feel like the biggest piece of shit. I don't know who I am, all I know is that I'm depressed and have issues of identity, gender, personality, and traumatic experiences that fucking haunt me. Every time I told myself to go seek help I failed. Every time I tried to have a good day I came back to my room and cried till nothing came out anymore. It was a fucking shitty year. I don't see anything changing in the new year. Don't even know if I'll make it through. Tough shit. I pray every day that I die because I don't have the courage to do it myself.",1
"Last year, I got dumped on the holidays. This year, it happened again. Please, God. Please let this coming year be better. Please. I can't take much more pain. :-(",0
Nobody would miss me anyways,0
"My boyfriend, a couple of his friends and a couple of my friends went out tonight to a bar. We were all kind of drunk and my boyfriend's friend asked a friend of mine if he take a shot from her belly button and she said no. He then asked me and u felt bad for him because he seemed really desperate, so I laid on the pool table and one of my friends poured the shot in my belly button and put a lemon in my mouth. He did the shot and then took the lemon out of my mouth with his mouth. My boyfriend is very upset. I was buzzed and was just having a good time and I didn't mean anything sexual by it. We have been dating for a couple of months. What should I do to make things right with him? I love him a lot and only want to be with him. I tried talking to him and he gives me one word answers and walks away. I have been crying for the last hour and I don't know what to do. I have anger and emotional problems and I'm not sure what's wrong with me. What should I do?",0
"I look for ""inspiration"" to start contemplating, usually in the ripped pages of my diary, or chat history with previously close friends. Sometimes I hear that tears are healthy when they're due.",0
"i just need to rant, i dont care if anyone sees this. 2017 has been the worst years of my life, school is fuckinh hard, i ended a long relationship with my girlfriend, not being invited to any parties or hangouts and spending the majority of the year alone. none of my friends will invite me to anything, i have to invite people places, which is really fucking hard when you have social anxiety. i feel like deleting snapchat would help lessen my hurt but that's just cutting off the majority of social contact. to top off the new year, found out my friend is now dating my ex. fuck me. i feel like shit because of all the missed opportunities caused my by social anxiety. sorry if i didn't use proper grammar, I can't bother right now.",0
"I thought I was okay I thought it was all just episodes but fuck this too much. It's new years, I'm supposed to celebrate with friends but all fucking alone. My dad had to call just to make sure someone told me happy New Year's. I'd be able to at least stomach but I check Snapchat and see ""people who made my 2017"" posts and I'm not in a single fucking one. I feel so fucking useless I feel so awful fuck new years fuck it fuck it fuck it",1
"Jan. 17, 2017 I told myself I was sick of going through every year wanting to die, wishing for death, and that if things hadn't changed I wouldn't see the start of 2018. For the first time in over a decade I had a couple months where I didn't want to kill myself, and that fell apart as quickly as it started. I'm worse off than I've been in a long time, and attempted suicide 4 times in the past 3 months, ending up with two hospitalizations and being committed to behavioral center. The only thing that kept me from attempting tonight is a fear of failure, ending up back in a hospital, and the fact that I now live with my parents again. I guess the fact that at some point last year I didn't want to die made me hesitant to follow through with my promise, but honestly I hate that I didn't. It's just another thing that I couldn't hold myself to. I don't really know why I'm writing this, I wanted to tell someone but I don't have anyone to tell that will actually listen at this point. Happy New Year friends",0
Another NYE spent alone in my room hating my own guts. I can't tell what's worse --- my self pity that I have no friends and just watch snapchats of people having fun without me even though I know its self defeating ORRR the fact I really can't blame people for not inviting me out because even I hate spending time with myself. Add onto that my parents havent allowed me out of the house since I was released from the hospital for being suicidal. My world has become my room which just fucking feeds into my depression like water on a grease fire. God I'm so sick of being me.,1
"I havnt been out of the house in awhile but there was a bunch of reasons y i stayed in.. My phone randomly shuts off w shitty battery life I need to get a new one , its freezing cold, I didnt feel like going to the bars tonight , I wasnt sure if I could make it back to my house cuz i couldnt stay at my friends house , he just kind of let me know last second... I just hope he invites me out again happy 2018 everyone btw ...",0
"what‚Äôs the point? why even try? all that i learned from this mess called ‚Äúlife‚Äù is that there is no point in trying, life gets harder and harder every single day to lead up to what? more hard work and stress to get us to nothing in the end. we humans work our asses off 24/7 for fucking jackshit. excuse me for my profanity here but i‚Äôm being serious, what actually is the point of this torturous cycle called ‚Äúlife‚Äù? all i‚Äôm willing to do right now is jump off an overpass because i can‚Äôt do it all over again...",0
"It's New year's day, and I just opened up to my parents about my depression. I could hear the disappointment and anger in my father's voice. My mother made no sign of acknowledgement. My brother was playing his games on his computer as usual. And now I feel like I did the wrong and told them about my issues. Happy new year. I'm sorry if this post sucks. I am just kind of running on steam. Sorry.",0
I've read a couple of chapters and this is probably the first self-help book that is working for me. What are your thoughts? Would you recommend?,0
"I'm a college student off on winter break, which means I have a lot of spare time on my hands. When I have nothing to do my depression gets 100x worse. My parents do not understand that it is hard for me to get up when there is no point to. Why would I get up when I don't have school to attend? Anyway, I was having an episode a couple of weeks ago and wanted to go home. My mother said to me "" why would you want to go home? All you do is sleep anyway, it's not like you have anything to do"". I am 19 years old and have alot of time left in school, which means I have a lot of time before I move out. How do I deal with my parents lack of understanding while getting the support I need? I'm not sure how to deal with this.",0
"I feel like I was doing great, but after tonight spending time with family and friends. Seeing their relationship and me being alone again has really brought me down again. When I got home after being a dd I jumped of discord with a few buddies, but I left after a while. I tried to drink, but I hate the taste and feeling after drinking alcohol. I talked to someone who gave me really good advice, but I don't know what to even to this year to turn my life around.",0
"So I've been pretty fucking depressed for the last couple of years and I've finally started to plan my own death. I don't know why I continue to perfect it because idk if it will ever be perfect, but I keep writing the details down whenever I feel like killing myself. I've told myself that when the plan is 100% perfect then I'm ""ok"" to end it.",0
And I'm having a depressive episode...what away to end and start a year!...Fuck Depression.,0
"Premise, I have nocturnal enuresis. I'm 17 years old and this condition begins to be the most difficult thing in my life to deal with. Tonight, my parents let me stay at my boyfriend's house as a New Year's gift, so I slept here. I've been finding my bed dry in the morning for a few days, so not wanting to put on a diaper in his house I simply slept in his sleeping bag on the sofa. I fucked up. Though I only slept 2 hours and a half, I managed to wet his sleeping bag, his sofa, and both my pants and my dress. I don't know what to do now, I don't have clean clothes with me, and I know he'll be super mad at me when he wakes up. I hate myself.",1
"I feel as if though I'm the only one has it right. I know that people should love each other. Yet people don't. No one treats anyone with respect. Everyone's is generally rude, mean, pessimistic, and hateful. I'm one of the only truly pure one I know in this world. We need to keep the pures and eliminate all the villans.

"Since about halfway through the current school year I've been extremely apathetic towards most activities, and have found the only source of entertainment in music and going to the gym. I've lost most of my appetite and have no desire to do most things at this point. Many video games I used to play just feel so dead and lacking of fun. Am I depressed, or am I just feeling low?",0
"Well, I am new to the Reddit app. I have been learning and researching about depression,anxiety, and many other mental disorders. But what I have came across is summarizing,paraphrasing,emotional intelligence, and emotional balance. Please consider reading this post. I have done a good amount of research. If someone has done research(science included) and want to share his/her opinion, they are scientifically correct because if you have science to defend your theory/opinion/idea/thesis/conclusions you are correct. To start off,summarizing and paraphrasing is the most important thing when researching/investigating because that way you'll learn anything with 100% perfect clarity. In order to paraphrase and summarize you simply have to put what you have read and seen in your words. Summarizing and paraphrasing is scientifically proven the best way to learn anything. Emotional Intelligence(EQ) or (EI) is the ability to take control of your emotions and also being able of controlling others emotionally such as intimidating someone, scaring someone,dominating someone, and so on. Emotional Intelligence is the skill of taking control of your emotions and by taking control of your emotions you will not let fear,panic,depression,anxiety,anger,shyness,nervousness control your mind. Always maintain your mind under control. EQ is much more important than IQ(intelligence). There are many articles on the internet claiming they can cure social anxiety, and other mental disorders, but in reality is much more complex than simply saying things like; Be more open to people, be confident, talk to girls. All of these tips/advises are nothing but helpless information for people with different mental disorders(same as mental illness). Emotional Balance means to control and keep your emotions balanced, don't let sadness, and other feelings/emotions take control of your mind and body completely.",0

"The company i work for is in a moving process so many departements are left vacant or just stuff that isnt picked up yet to the new location. Wich typically means fridges with plenty of old food in it and beer, and i had to work christmas and i allready went through a difficult time and i am still doing it. I just got some bright idea that all the beer around the building werent going to be missed so i took some of it (4 cans all in different departments...) thinking that it wouldnt be missed since they have allready left... And i felt somekind of ¬´fuck you mentality¬ª too them since they were the ones that put me on this shift and never give anything in return... i drank the beers when i got home and dissolved further into my missery till my mom had to throw me into the ER a few days later. Now on sick leave and just got home, i have felt a big regret for stealing the beer... Fuck... I cannot grasp why i even had the thought of doing this and i dont know what to do if they find out!!! Its just some cheap beer i could easily buy for 10 bucks and now my job can be on the line because of this... idk what to do!!! I feel so ashamed!!!

"I have progressed to a point where suicide is plaguing my thoughts every day. Any form of distraction: YouTube and Social Media, hanging out with my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù school.

But I even then I had been exponentially losing interest in school and my grades reflect that shift. I can identify that I am failing I am so pathetic all of my friends are just friends with me out of pity I can trust no one. Everyone has abandoned me and I feel like shit every single goddamn day. Thoughts of suicide and all of my past failures and embarrassing moments no matter how small, are all huge and I feel as if everyone Either hates me, takes advantage of me for what little intelligence is left, or is just friends with me out of pity or to bully me and belittle me. I have lost the will to Live ages ago. The only thing that keeps me going is the biological urge to not kill myself but even that is being degraded by all of these thoughts. I cannot go on with this. The sense of depression, embarrassment/cringe, even overpowering nostalgia (if you could call it that) for times of before, where I wasn‚Äôt so pathetic and stupid. I want to die",0

"It just feels like life is a stack of endless bias and trauma from being born. I would prefer not to spend my life friendless, alone, and bullied or biasd for what seems like just being alive.

Life is truly miserable I can‚Äôt even get out of bed anymore. I use to want to fight to be a musician. For what? To continue being biasd and mistreated? Fucking hell where does this shit end. I guess the real question is how do people find ways to live for something they don‚Äôt mind being biasd for. Something that is more gratifying than actually suffering. For me it is making music and sharing it. That‚Äôs all. If I don‚Äôt blossom as an artists I can‚Äôt see any other way to make the pain worth fighting on for. I really need to focus on my music even if It kills me trying to reach my goals. What else is there for me to be alive for. I hate being biasd and hate most things in life. Having a mediocre job isn‚Äôt worth being mistreated for. I have to die trying to do something from my wildest dreams or I will pull my plug. I‚Äôm just talking about myself.

I AM A MAN FFS. To sum up the problem is that when I had given up on life everything seemed so ok and calm and now that I am putting effort into making my life better I cannot fucking control my emotions... I am like a fucking volcano, crying at ""random"" times, yelling out of nowhere, punching walls etc. Has anyone been through a similar situation?",0
"Hello everyone, just to preface my doctor has diagnosed me with depression, anxiety, and ocd. Recently I have been filled with self hatred. I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù and weigh 140 pounds. I am convinced I am fat even though this is a very average body weight. When I look in the mirror I think how ugly I am. People tell me I am attractive but I do not believe them. I feel like my life is a failure. I graduate college with a degree in fine arts and history with honors...this is not good enough. I feel as if I am very ignorant and perceived as such. I‚Äôm have traveled abroad three different times...yet when others tell me about their travels I feel inadequate. When ever I go out into public I think everyone hates me and is talking about me. I also constantly google mental illness and symptoms because I am convinced something is majorly wrong with me...even though three doctors have told me I am ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. I take multiple mental health quizzes everyday to see if I have lost my mind. I am constantly asking my coworkers at work what they think about me.

"I don't think I enjoy life. I enjoy the moments most, where I either distract or numb myself from most of what's happening around me, like when I play videogames, stay up late, wake up late, over and undereat or get myself drunk. I've felt like this for so long, I just don't want to suffer. I want to redo and right all the things that I wronged All the people I've hurt, all the relationships that I broke. I know I don't get a second chance at all that and neither can I fix what's wrong with me, why I can't feel happy, joyful and innocent.

"Like the title says, I often times feel like I'm just a side character in the lives of those around me (19 M in college). It sucks. I was diagnosed with MDD about 2 months ago after struggling to convince myself I needed help for about 2 years, and it just kind of feels like despite trying to be more present in the lives of those around me I end up hurt and ignored no matter what I try. For example, I have tried to get into the habit of asking my roommates what they've been up to recently, how their day is going, if they want to get food, etc., and it just kinda feels like they don't have the time or motivation to reciprocate. When I try and share something from my life, I just feel like they shrug me off or ignore me completely. Every day feels like I am growing apart from those around me and needless to say it's not fun. I am introverted by nature, so socializing can often be exhausting, so I guess it's just even more insulting when those around me blow me off despite the colossal effort it can take to even say hello.",0
"So I‚Äôve struggled with depression on and off my whole life. I graduated recently and was lucky enough to land a pretty decent job. However, since I‚Äôve moved and started the job I‚Äôve relapsed heavy. I know it‚Äôs common for people to be lonely when making a big move and being in a new environment. I tried to end it all when I was in hs and told myself I would never go back to that place. I decided to get help a few months ago when those thoughts came back and I‚Äôm glad I did. I won‚Äôt bore you with all the details but work was the reason for a lot of my issues so i decided to be proactive and change it. Well today i just got an offer at a company that I‚Äôve wanted to work at since I started college! And best of all it‚Äôs back in the same town as all my friends who graduated with me. I know I will be happy there, more so than this place. And I‚Äôll be surrounded by people who made me enjoy my life for those short 4 years. I‚Äôm hoping this was the change that I was looking for. I made every excuse as to why nothing would get better and to just live it out. I start next month! Btw I signed up for BetterHelp for my therapy. It‚Äôs not for everyone but I‚Äôm very shy and have had bad experiences with psychiatrist and counselors. It was just more excuses I made to not get help.",0

The problem is I cant seem to stay at this type of job for more than a year. Ive been with 4 companies already within that span of 3 years.

Back then i didnt think it would be wrong because I thought i made it really clear that while I liked him, we weren't exclusive. Sometimes the self blame and guilt get so immense and overwhelming and I want to go, too. Sometimes I'm terrified that if it was really my fault, it would come bite me in the ass one day. That thought intensifies the urges to tap out, because I think it would take the blame with me. It also scares me whenever I remember that analogy about glasses being full, and what if this is how my glass spills over? How do I empty my glass? Is it my fault? Will I ever feel like it wasn't? Is it okay to feel like it wasn't?",0

"Since I started college, my life has gone downhill because of my health. I‚Äôm only 21, but I have multiple illnesses that will only make life miserable for me. On top of depression and anxiety, I also have chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic pelvic pain syndrome, migraines, and porn-induced erectile dysfunction. I hate my life and just want to die.",0
"It's been anout 5 days since this sadness hit me, and all I've wanted to do is sleep. I don't even know what's causing it. I woke up fine (5 days ago) then at some point during the day it hit me. I can't even begin to think of any reason for it, it makes me feel selfish...my life is actually going pretty well right now :/",1
"Everyone ends up hating me eventually. My psychologist of almost ten years blew up at me and kicked me out of my last session. I am doubting every interaction I have with every person I meet. I‚Äôm doubting every interaction I have with every single one of my friends. I can‚Äôt get my substance bias issues under control. I‚Äôm my own worst enemy. I was accused of being a bully and was subsequently bullied by the workplace bullying system. I uprooted my life to change for the better and as part of the domino of doing so my dog was killed. I would give anything to be a different person right now. To not have to be my awful, repulsive, contemptible self.",1
"I feel so low, I feel like I am never good enough and hopeless at everything. I am self medicating with wine as well so it‚Äôs a bloody merry go round. I feel I am constantly saying I am fine, nothings wrong and wear my happy smiley mask to hide how I really am. I have been on the tablets and have had therapy in the past but it hasn‚Äôt worked. I have a wonderful man healthy kids all grown up but I can‚Äôt seem to be happy.",1
"I just can‚Äôt stop thinking about it, it‚Äôs constant, it‚Äôs all i think about. Before i sleep, when i wake up, and whenever my minds not totally occupied. Sometimes i contemplate suicide: the action then followed by thoughts of an afterlife, if there‚Äôs even one. I can never stop obsessing over it and normally i‚Äôm the one giving advice such as life and so forth, but recently i‚Äôve been actually contemplating ‚Äúwhat happens when we‚Äôre all dead?‚Äù and that just keeps me up and thinking every moment. This is made worse by people telling me ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry it‚Äôll all be okay‚Äù or ‚Äújust live life to the fullest‚Äù something cheesy and dumb. Quite honestly, if life is as pointless as i think and as it seems, aren‚Äôt we just better off dead? To live is to suffer, pain after pain, at what gain? The humiliation and satisfaction of nothing short of a horrible life. The experiences all meaning nothing once we‚Äôre gone, and yet we‚Äôre all still here? Why? Just why? If there was any way out i think sometimes cutting it short would be the only. I just can‚Äôt see wading thru this torture we call life as an option.",0
"I dont know if this is the right sub, I just need a place to vent right now. So, I dont know where to start. I have been depressed for over 6 years now, but always managed to see the good things in life. But for the last 2 months it got worse. I randomly have the urge to just cry all day long. I've just been holding it back, which probably isn't such a good idea. Also, I still live with my mom, and every time I get home, she just yells at me. In the last 3 weeks I got really tired. As soon as I get home I just lay down in bed and try to relax, and even my vision is getting darker I think. I dont know what's going on with me and i dont think I can keep going much longer.",0
"I feel the depression crawling back right how. I could feel my heart getting heavier by the day. I‚Äôm feelin stressed, tired, sick, and sleepy all at the same time. I‚Äôm having more bad days then good and it doesn‚Äôt feel fun to wake up. I‚Äôm not looking forward to the day like I did a while ago. Need ideas, inspiration, advice, anything to help me get out of this funk. Stopped seeing my therapist last month due to money/funding. I‚Äôve been going on and off for 5 years, the past 2 years have been consecutive. Is it normal to feel like this after you stop therapy?",0
"I wish I could've done something with myself like become stronger and stop myself becoming a problem. I wish I could've done alot of stuff but now im here contemplating if I should end it all so I have nothing to lose now then later, and I know my family would be sad but they already talk about me behind my back about how much of a pain i am, and there is no way I am going to let them know about how I feel on the inside right now. Im at my breaking point and all I wish for is to be left alone to perish, I know it's selfish but I never asked to be here in the first place.",1
"You‚Äôve probably haven‚Äôt heard from me since I made that concerning post awhile ago, then me deleting it. Welp I‚Äôm alive still, but I was very close to ending it today. My head was spiraling more than I‚Äôve ever felt, and light started to blur and noise was distorted. Keep in mind, I wasn‚Äôt dying or gaining out of consciousness, I was just walking around my school and I heard the noise of a helicopter, while the sunset was gleaming in my eye. I was just trying to find that damn helicopter since that noise was just consuming me, and my whole world was vanishing, and I lost my meaning completely. I just wanted to end it. I didn‚Äôt know how, but I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be alive tomorrow. My mind was gone. I then sat down and cried. Through the hole of the tables outside, I saw a pair of converse. While crying and trying to hide my tears from the cheer team that just got back from practice, I saw friend‚Äôs converse who had just came back from 711. They were surprised to see me there, and gave me the rest of their iced coffee. They didn‚Äôt know I was crying since I played it off that I was sleeping. We spent another 30 minutes eating brownies and talking about our day. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever appreciated a person so much in my life. I never knew that the person who saved me would be the one I would least expect. I owe them my life.",0
"It‚Äôs your average story everyone‚Äôs heard: no friends, broken family, bullied throughout elementary and high school, rough breakup, only escapes through drugs and self harm. I just can‚Äôt take it anymore i feel so worthless, I‚Äôm turning 18 this year and i think i can no longer go on like this i‚Äôve wanted to die since i was 11. why is life so painful every day is a constantly struggle for me and i can‚Äôt even find motivation to keep going on. I cant even picture myself as an adult, i see nothing. These are all just words i cant even put together properly without autocorrect cause i‚Äôm crying too much, i just want to feel okay. How does being loved feel like? I‚Äôve only felt it once with someone who changed their mind and started caring about somebody else in that particular way and broke off all contact with me. I‚Äôm so tired of people giving me ‚Äútough love‚Äù and saying my decisions are selfish, i know i am, it‚Äôs just making it worst. I just want it all to stop, but it never did. ‚ÄúIt gets better‚Äù is burned into my mind but when does it? I‚Äôve been trying so hard to continue on and make improvements but it always ends back at square one.

"I'm rewatching Bojack Horseman on Netflix for the umpteenth time because that's the only thing I do that I enjoy anymore. I've recently noticed that in the show Secretariat is right, that you should never stop ruining, never look back, all that you have is what's ahead. That's what I've been doing and it seems to be working as long as I don't stop. My last relationship almost killed me, my ex was abusive. Before her I survived since shit, sexual assaults and the like. I've done terrible things too, things for survival, some things simply because I was a bastard. Now i keep myself busy. I work 50+ hrs and volunteer for the entire weekend. I have pets that need constant attention, and I'm constantly moving. When I'm not running around I always have a drink in hand. It works. The only time I look back is when I'm falling asleep, that's the worst. That's when I can't escape it. Thankfully sleep cones soon. But I need to keep moving. If I stop I'll be consumed. Im terrified of that. I can't handle that. I can't relive it, I just can't. I don't know what to do anymore. I come from a long line of alcoholics and I'm fast on my way to join them. I'm so tired but I can't risk showing down. I just wish it would end but I'm too scared to do anything about it. I'm ruining as fast and as hard as I can but I'm slowing down and it's catching up. I thought it would get easier but it isn't.",1

I‚Äôve been suicidal for such a long time now. I see my therapist and psychiatrist weekly. I was in the hospital for 4 days a couple weeks ago. I‚Äôm on a shit ton of meds. I don‚Äôt see any other way out. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll happen this week but I can‚Äôt promise next week. I have no passion for anything in my life nor do I have fun anymore.

"Well, good evening ladies and gentlemen. Tonight i'm going to kill myself. There is no hope or desire to continue breathing. Loneliness does not want or plan to get away from me and I have already tried everything to escape but i will always be alone. I do not seek attention, advice, or a savior. All I want is to say goodbye, at least, to strangers who, in the same way if they knew me, would reject me. I am an extremely disposable being. I feel very calm and I would like to hope with the idea that, when I die, I will be much calmer, but I cannot. I really don't want to die, but my life has no solution. Nobody can help me. So, goodbye.",1

It would be so much easier just to end it, I‚Äôve never been good with decisions.",1
"I'm suicidal because, of, I failed graduating many times, school. How my dad treats me, bullying me. How I make myself feel awful by judging myself all the time, me. I'm unmotivated in school, I dread school, I hate school. I'm a highly sensitive person, hsp. I'm a procrastinator. Suicide has become a normal thing for me. Even in better days, I think about suicide, ways to die. I just wanna give up on life, on school and die. . I probably have more reasons but this is it",1
"I don't have the strength or really the means to do it right. I just want instant death when I least expect it. I don't feel like I'm supposed to be alive, every day is completely miserable. Most days have always been at the very least not good. The months are just passing by now, I haven't had a real friend in years. My girlfriend lives hundreds of miles away and it feels like she doesn't care anymore about me because of how I am. I don't even blame her. I'm ready to die, it's just so hard to do so. Every day I look at suicide methods and and it's the same fucking articles and posts. It's almost funny. I stopped taking my useless antidepressants because I was tired of being asexual, now I have these brain zaps and it's so weak. I just laugh or cry for no reason at times. All there is in this house is yelling. A simple chore feels sisyphean, why bother? I'm 18 now but I don't feel like I have had any kind of childhood or teenagehood. Where did it go? I'm supposed to be happy about college or something. that's what they tell me. i'm tired of typing, fuck this",0
"Throwaway account. Not like it matters. Today I wrote suicide notes to my mom and boyfriend. I feel so guilty but things have really taken a bad turn and I can't do it anymore. I miss how things were. I told my boyfriend I'd stay alive until my birthday, which is in 18 days, and if nothing has improved despite my efforts by then, then I'm going to do it. But if I'm being honest, I don't know if I can stick around that long. It keeps getting worse. I hate feeling this way.",0
"It seems like all I do is cry. I needed my cello bow re-haired so my professor sent me to an unfamiliar building and gave me instructions to drop it off at some lady‚Äôs office. I was already having a bad day because I couldn‚Äôt get myself out of bed to go to my first class. Then she tells me that she can‚Äôt accept the bow because I need to visit the website first, set up an account, etc. At that point I start crying.

"First of all, sorry... I‚Äôm Brazilian and my english is broken. I'm 26 years old, I think I'm beautiful and I look younger, but I've been in severe depression for over ten years because of family losses and my borderline disorder, and I think I was born mentally ill. I was hospitalized in 2016 and 2017 and under psychiatric treatment, but I think that I have no cure. I stopped going to university, I stopped working, everything goes wrong, but last year I thought everything was going to change. I met someone and helped him, gave him house, food, love and my family accepted him, but he made it worse, made me go through hell, left me at the rock bottom, and then this year he left, he left me!! Now he is living a happy life and I that helped him.. well I‚Äôm living in chaos. THAT'S NOT FAIR! WHY EVERYTHING GOES WRONG IN MY LIFE? I love my family, my 25 cats and I still love him.

Right now I'm feeling very alone I live in a city and don't know very many people because with depression and anxiety that I haven't treated for 7 years keeps me from wanting to meet new people because out in the real world it's scary. Always afraid that I will mess up what I say and that people will think I'm stupid. The people I do know half turned out to be horrible people that have now resorted to trying to tear me down daily. I love my daughter and my boyfriend but sometimes you want to talk to someone else. I don't know how else to explain it I just feel really trapped. End sad rant.,1

"I‚Äôm 16 I‚Äôve been severely suicidal since I was 10. When I was around 11 I slit my wrists and my parents walked in when I was bleeding out. They said they were ‚Äòbusy‚Äô working and gave me antiseptic cream and bandaids instead of taking me to the hospital my dad walked in later that night and cried over me and basically called me selfish. No one ever talked about it again and I never received help. I‚Äôm now in 11th grade and school has never been worse I‚Äôve already had 2 pretty serious breakdowns and I‚Äôm only 6 weeks in. Through extensive online research I found some ‚Äòpainless‚Äô suicide methods and purchased the drugs and blades necessary to pull it off. I almost did it the other night but I want to finalise some things first. My mum is gone so just now I went to my dad for a final plea for help and when I told him he said ‚Äúit‚Äôs all in your head‚Äù ‚Äú the only thing you have is self pity‚Äù etc. I just know I‚Äôm going to end it all pretty soon, I‚Äôm not sure when but almost definitely soon.

I have nothing. There‚Äôs no hope left, there‚Äôs nothing more for me to try. I‚Äôve been fighting depression for nearly a decade. So many different therapists, coping mechanisms, meds of different kinds and different doses. And here I am. 8 years later and in more pain than ever. I wanted to get better so bad. But it‚Äôs not possible. It‚Äôs just not possible. There‚Äôs nothing anymore. I dropped out of school. I have no job. No friends. I‚Äôm quickly running out of money.

My husband has always been a people person so hes made friends pretty quick. There's days were hes out and I'm sitting home alone. So alone. I cry in secret. I keep things to myself idk where I've gotten the idea that I need to be strong and crying is weakness. I tried talking to my husband last night and I was having a hard time talking. He ended up leaving and just sleeping in the livingroom which didnt help this situation. I miss my mom I miss my sister I really fuckin miss my friends.

And I‚Äôve seen how they complain about other people so I can‚Äôt complain or talk to them. I know it sounds pathetic but reddit has been the only way I can talk about it because I can‚Äôt talk about it with anyone else.

Immediately being overwhelmed with all of the thoughts that I was able to escape in sleep. Just a wave of feeling like complete and utter garbage overtaking my mind as soon as I‚Äôm able to open my eyes. Remembering the things the things that have ruined my life up until this point.,1
"Commute, work, commute, sleep. That‚Äôs pretty much my life right now. I feel tired every day can‚Äôt get anything done in my personal life. I can‚Äôt even game or watch anime anymore I‚Äôm so damn tired. Couple that with very intense loneliness that I‚Äôve felt my whole life (22M never had a girlfriend) and you have me. I‚Äôve found that throughout my life people just lose interest in me and always end up leaving. It‚Äôs always just a matter of time.. I mean it‚Äôs understandable as all I do is sleep and work I guess. Honestly I can‚Äôt take it anymore I just want something to change, whatever the hell it may be.

"I don't know where to start. Everything I do with my child is wrong. My first mistake was having her at 17. She's 2 now and she can't stand being around me. Every time I try to give her attention, she tells me to go away and runs to grandma. She won't even let me be the one to put her to sleep at night. I do everything I can to try to keep her happy but it's not good enough. She'd rather be at daycare than at home with me; she cries every day when I pick her up. As soon as we get home, she goes straight to grandma and ignores me for the rest of the day. I get angry sometimes and my first reaction is to yell at her when she's having a bad day and I feel like a total piece of garbage afterward. Am I really a worse parent than my abusive mother?",1

"In 2014, I first entered university and encountered a lot of changes: new people, new environment, new classes, and so on. At the time, I had a lot of acne, which prevented me from meeting people. Furthermore, I had an identity crisis and started asking fundamental questions of life such as: ""who am I? why am I here? where do I go?"", and constantly thought about life and death. I wanted to harm myself and other people because I was in such a lonely, miserable spot when everyone else looked so happy. This lasted a few months. In between, I picked up lifting weights, practiced meditation, and my acne cleared up. Fast forward 5 years, I am completely happy. I have good friends, a good relationship with my family, and I have a stable career. Since my environment improved, my negative thoughts subsided. But I know that depressions don't go away with time, and that's what I'm worried about. So was I suffering from clinical depression in 2014? Or was it just circumstantial thing?",0
"I‚Äôm so over it. I‚Äôm so over everything. I‚Äôve been getting worse in my isolation, but it yields better results for the world and myself for me to be alone. Maybe i‚Äôll go insane, but what does it matter. My boyfriend does not love me, none of them ever have. My best friend does not like me that much. I have so much wrong with me physically and mentally, if society wasnt so accomodating to idiots like myself i‚Äôd be dead. I should be dead. My boss thinks i‚Äôm racist because i am terrible at communicating something. Once i loose that job, i‚Äôll have to deal with my dad, who is bad enough as it is to deal with when i do have a job. Loud noises make me panic, i dont trust anyone, i like to deprive myself of sleep.. if i was anywhere else i‚Äôd be dying slowly. Or maybe someone would of come along and put me out of my misery. But i dont feel complete without the misery, i dont like to inflict it on others unlike people i know, i just dont feel like myself unless i‚Äôm depressed and suffering. I feel greedy if i‚Äôm not unhappy. I listen to everyone, but no one listens to me. When they do, i over do it because i guess i am just selfish and thats all they see of me. So when i ever open up again, they roll their eyes and leave. God my head hurts. The virus just needs to wipe me out.",1
"I hate myself so much and everyone hates me too even my own boyfriend. He doesn‚Äôt say it but I could tell he thinks I am terrible and miserable and that he's better than me. Why is it so hard to take care of myself? I just want to be dead already so I don‚Äôt have to do eat, exercise, shower... why are these things so god damn hard for me and so easy for everyone else? I am such a fucking burden and everyone knows I am a stupid piece of shit. Why won‚Äôt god just let me die",1

"Objectively, I say I'm pro-choice, but I just can't be with him. I want him and need him here. I'm already suicidal myself outside of this situation. I'm being selfish, but I don't know how I'll survive this. I can't see a future without him, and I know there will be a hole in my heart for the rest of my life that I'm not ready for. He's in a bad situation and I can't fix any of it. He's says he's ready to go. I know my feelings just put more stress on him, so I try to avoid talking about them as much as I'd like to. We're long distance so I can't even touch him. He's been pushing me away for awhile now and it hurts so much. I'm also struggling morally with allowing him to go through with it. I won't have anyone to lean on because you can't talk to people about allowing someone to suicide. I think my one friend who knows about the situation will think I'm a bad person for not getting the authorities involved. Please help. I'm bursting at the seams. I'm not functioning.",0
"I (20 m) may or may not have depression and if I do it‚Äôs very mild, however that being said I feel this pain because I messed up the future I had with the girl I seriously would‚Äôve hand crafted. I was madly in love with her but long distance made it not work in the end, I don‚Äôt have a problem moving on, but what‚Äôs hurts more than the break up did is finding out within a couple of months she‚Äôs met another guy, flew to him, and is planning on moving in with him. This could‚Äôve so easily been me and her it‚Äôs painful. When we were together in person I can easily say that was the happiest 2 weeks of my life. Now I get it most people will think ‚Äújust find someone else‚Äù but like some others I assume I am extremely picky. And then people will be like ‚Äújust don‚Äôt be as picky‚Äù and my response is I will never be as happy with someone if I settle for less. I‚Äôve never been this unhappy with living, what are good tips for turning this around and being happy again? There‚Äôs really only one thing I‚Äôm looking for in my life right now and that‚Äôs someone to connect to.",0
"Everyone is constantly interrupting me and talking over me. Whenever I try talking about my problems no one seems to care and just counteracts it by saying how they have it harder. I mean, I guess they do but I wish I could just talk to someone at school without them saying how they have like so much more work and they got two hours of sleep last night. That‚Äôs why I hate being nice and supportive sometimes. I listen to other people, I help other people and I feel like it almost never gets returned. I‚Äôm there for other people but it feels like no one is there for me. And it‚Äôs not only at school. At home, I‚Äôm the youngest and it feels like they just ignore what I say, and don‚Äôt listen to anything I have to say. They are so proud of my sister, and I am too, but they don‚Äôt care as much about my accomplishments and awards. Maybe its because they arent as impressive as hers?",1
"Give me one good reason I should not kill myself right now. The whole world is going to shit and no one can change that. The only people that could help refuse to. The world will never be a good place, it will always be on the brink. Everyone always says to just look on the bright side, but what is the point? For every good thing you could say, I could name off 3 bad things. Why shouldn‚Äôt I just end it right now and save myself the trouble. Everyone dies eventually, there is no point in being afraid of the inevitable. I house I can‚Äôt afford will be underwater anyways, if were not all dead by the time I need one. Everyone always says that I shouldn‚Äôt kill myself because people would be sad. Welp, I‚Äôm not a good person. I‚Äôm selfish, rude, hopeless, and just annoying in general. As is everyone. To me there is no point in prolonging the inevitable. So please if you have a good actual answer that is not just ‚Äúsome people would be inconvenienced‚Äù than please tell me.",0
"It‚Äôs like the title says. I disappoint everyone, myself included. I cannot go to school because of my mental health and my parents are pissed, as well as my teachers.

"What‚Äôs it like when you come out of a depressive episode? I know it‚Äôs not sudden for most. I just want to know because although I haven‚Äôt been depressed my whole life, I have been in a very deep depressive episode the past year and a half and my memory is appalling. I‚Äôve genuinely totally forgotten most of my life, especially how I felt during previous periods of time. (This memory loss is related to dissociation and prolonged trauma as well as low serotonin) My friend said that she‚Äôs come out of her depression and that she feels different. She feels ambitious and the dog has gone. Things feel less difficult. It‚Äôs given me so much hope and I want to hear your success stories. Because I know that it‚Äôs common to feel like it‚Äôll never end. But I need to know it will. I‚Äôm already so much better thanks to antidepressants but I still struggle a lot.",0
"This is my first ever post on reddit. A friend of mine said I should post here and I‚Äôve been finding every excuse not to but I am afraid that I have nothing left so why not? Here goes....I‚Äôve literally given everything I have to my marriage and I‚Äôm not getting anything in return. We have 4 amazing children together and they are everything to me but often times I feel like it‚Äôs only a matter of time before they realize I‚Äôm not worth their time and they too move on from me. I found out my wife was cheating on me and for some reason I still wanted to work things out with her. Well fast forward 4 months later and things are happening with another guy. Every confrontation about it is basically flipped and I‚Äôm made to feel like this is all my fault. I‚Äôve never cheated on her and I‚Äôve never thought about it a single time. I‚Äôm feeling so low that I don‚Äôt want to be here anymore. I feel like a stranger in my own home. People tell me to think of my children but what good is that when you truly believe they will be better off without you? I‚Äôm not worth trying to make a marriage work so why would I be worth it to them? They didn‚Äôt even choose me. I attempted suicide before, just before Christmas. My sister-in-law found me and called 911 and I ended up in a hospital for a week. I promised I would never let that happen again but I just can‚Äôt help the thoughts coming back.

"Because I am so tired of this shit. I've tried to sit them down and explains syuff to them. It didn't work. Never works. They don't outright say that they're punishing me because I'm depressed, but the things I do or don't do because I'm depressed get punished. I have bad grades, I'm failing in almost everything. I'm trying but with depression is really hard. You know what I get for trying? My phone and videogames taken away. I can't fall asleep at night because of anxiety. You know what I get for having nightly panic attacks? Yelled at for ""staying up all night."" You know what I get for having trouble keeping my room clean? Grounded. Tommorow I'm losing my phone because my grades are bad. Ignore the fact that I'm trying, yeah let's only care about a damn letter of the alphabet because THAT makes more sense than a flippin living person! t(-_- )t I don't even like my phone that much. I'm not one of those people who are super addicted or nothing. But my phone is a coping mechanism. Without being able to vent or watch some relaxing video to calm me down I'm probably just gonna end up cutting myself. What should I do? Or should I just suck it up and deal with their butts for the next few years? Which, I don't know if I could survive the latter.",0

I have to sleep twenty feet away from that, and I am told to man up just deal with it. Well I'm fucking tired of pretending. I've been molested and my father left me, not once but twice. How can be happy with that? What pisses me off is that sense he left me and won't awnser my calls I'll never get to see my little sisters. Two of them that I'll never get too meet. But you know I'm a good boy, I just need to smile through the pain and just be happy. Right? That's what my family says to do, that's what society says to do.

"I've been like that, having suicidal thoughts, since i was 13. I have exams in about 2 months, which right now is the main couse of my stress. My parents are also about to divorce in propably a year (knowing how long this sort of stuff takes). I live with my mom, who is alwayes really stressed about and in a hurry. Recently i have also been having a heart ache, which the doctor said is caused by stress and uneasiness. My mom knows there's something wrong with me and suggested a therapist to help me deal with my stress, but i dont think she really understands why im acting this way. My original plan was to give myself a week and then kill myself if nothing changes. Well it's already wednesday. I still fell the same as before, but maybe i should tell somebody? I don't really have any friends i could trust so i'm thinking of telling my mum. She already has a lot of problems though. I've already tried telling her once (i just said that i'm depressed, not that i want to commit suicide), when i was 14 and she just said that everybody feels like that sometimes and forgot about it the next day. How can i tell her so that she understands?",0

I'm such a useless artist, everything I draw is complete garbage, anyways. I have no other skills in this world. High school dropout, McDonalds employee, virgin, friendless, stupid.

I left a domestic violent relationship and they‚Äôre days that haunt me of what happened and it shuts me down even more. I sit alone in my car at lunch because no one wants to be around me.

"For context, I‚Äôm 19, in my first year of college, and for one month - since I failed one of my exams - I lost everything I thought I had. All my friends, my crush, and for a week now, my Dad, who just wants to be upset at me forever for not helping him to the end with carrying some construction material. For one month, I‚Äôve entered a downward spiral, amplified by events such as the rejection mentioned earlier, or not being able to give the license exam two days ago because of some stupid policemen who told me that I ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt pay the license tax‚Äù correctly. And not being able to make up with my Dad, who just hates me. The final straw came an hour ago, when I got laughed at when I entered the classroom. Just because I happened to enter at the same time as some other older students who didn‚Äôt belong there. When I left the college, no one noticed. It is probably a matter of weeks or even days before I take my life. Nothing is worth it. Nothing makes me happy. Nothing can save me now. Nothing. And what‚Äôs more, no one (apart from probably my mother and sister) won‚Äôt miss me. But let‚Äôs be serious, they‚Äôll live without me. And also, I‚Äôm sure no one will notice this post, in the heap of posts of people with more serious life issues. This is really what makes me a failure: not being able to live happily in a life which would seem ok to most people here. So yeah.",0

I'm only living so other people don't feel bad about me when I'm gone. What a shitty way to spend the rest of my existence",1
Has someone here survived an attempt or knows someone who did? I'd like to know how life looks like when you survive. How it's gonna impact social life (got no friends and family so probably not too much). How it impacts work and school (trying to graduate 2nd time. Dropped out cause of massive depressive episode and cause I got homeless). And just other things like are you put in therapy or even hospitalized and for how long. I'm in a situation where I just wish to die. But I can't kill myself cause I'm worried about what might happen if it fails or I somehow survive. Like how my life that's already the worst could get even worse then.,0

I used to like being around people, but as i reach the age of 25 i feel like i‚Äôve been struggling for an eternity. Im truly tired of this fucking 9-5 society everyone seems to be able to spend 40 years in and come out accomplished. It seems no matter how many counsellors i appoint myself with, or how many doctors appointments im making nobody is helping me and i feel im reaching my breaking point. I know i cant live without society, but this cant continue. Ive tried steps to help myself, counselling, therapy, doctors appointments; all leads back to the same bullshit place im in now, stuck in society. Ive recently acquired my second dui, have a breathalyzer in my vehicle and spend most days sitting at home thinking about how much i hate interacting with people.

I remember, when i was a child, my parents often dont have money to buy tge food, so i used to visit my grandma, and take some food from her, to feed me and my younger brothers. i remember, once my dad came back home, so drunk, that he beated my mother,and btoke a glass door. There were a fucktone of blood.It was sticky and smelled horrible. When i was 13 i was raped by my drunk dad. Nobody knows about it. Also 2 months ago,i found a gf, but she broke with the me up.

"It is midnight and I cannot sleep again. I cannot remember the last time I slept through the night. I sleep in tiny spurts throughout the day but can never stay down for long. I often have nightmares even when I do stay sleeping for some time. The other night, for example, I woke up screaming. I had been dreaming that I was eating a bowl of cereal and looked down and my spoon was covered in spiders. I actually like spiders so I am not sure why it scared me so bad. My husband reached over and held my hand and shushed me until I calmed down. It seems like he is too good to me always. I feel like I don't deserve it. Tonight I looked outside the window at the world as I often do throughout the day. I thought to myself: the people that I have met, all of them, all of the people I have come across... does anyone of them ever think of me? Ever? Do they ever wonder how I am? Even just for a second? If they did, I wish I knew, because I feel like a shadow living life alone inside my house day after day. At the same time I feel that I am unworthy of friendship, community, love. Today at therapy my therapist asked me my goals. I said... to have a friend and to be a part of a small community that truly cared for me. But I have never felt or experienced that. I only know what friendships and loving communities are like from observing others. I truly pity anyone who would want to befriend me, because I think I would make the worst friend.",1

I got into a bit of a car accident today and burst my tyre and I just don't have the energy to sort it. I just don't have the energy to keep on fighting. I've been talking to a few people online and that's helped but none of them are around to talk at the moment. I was talking to someone I really liked and they've decided to stop talking to me. I'm not sure why and I just have no one. I want to end... I want to end it now but I'm to much of a fucking pussy. I haven't been this close to ending it in a while though... I don't know what to expect from this, it just helps me clear my head I guess. I'm not really sure...",1
I don‚Äôt like people. I have isolated myself from the outside world for over six years now. I don‚Äôt want to have long conversations with no one. I just need the strongest meds I can get to combat my issues. Before I try something illegal which I have been tempting to use for some time now. Is there a way for me to achieve this without having to see a psychologist? Sorry if I‚Äôm coming off a certain way. I‚Äôm just tired and need help.,0
"I‚Äôm about to turn 20 soon, and lately I realized I don‚Äôt even enjoy living. Everyday I wake up, I don‚Äôt even want to get out of bed I just want to lay there. When I do get out of bed I just hate doing anything. It doesn‚Äôt matter what I‚Äôll be doing I just rather be dead all the time so I don‚Äôt have to do anything? Maybe I‚Äôm lazy or something but I just hate doing stuff? I rather just be dead lol, so I can just be in peace.. I‚Äôm on antidepressants and they help but I still don‚Äôt enjoy life, there‚Äôs more why I don‚Äôt enjoy life mostly cause I can‚Äôt hold a job, or keep any friends or even talk to anyone. I just feel like a fucking ghost. Been thinking about just ending up, but can‚Äôt get enough courage to do it. Hopefully soon I just say fuck it and do it.",0
"I spoke to Lifeline (I'm from australia) and the person I spoke to was no help. Honestly, I wake up every morning regretting i did not die in my sleep the night before &amp; explained that to them, they decided to get into a debate about fucking religion of all things. I think at this point i just need someone to talk to, to be able to convince me why it's not a good idea to just slit my fucking throat or just jump off my 3rd floor balcony. Which I haven't done yet because I'm such a fucking coward. Honestly i'm just so tired of life &amp; just want to end it all somehow without bothering my family. I don't know what else to do. I seriously envy americans with their easy access to guns. FYI, I'm on anti depressants already which are no fucking help what so ever. There's always the voice in the back of my head that tells me that once i do it, i'll be ok, I wont have to experience this shit anyway so why not just go ahead with it anyway.",0
"Life just hasn‚Äôt been enjoyable for me anymore, I did attempt hanging myself a year ago but failed. I was going to jump off a roof after that but my grandparents by a miracle called me before it to wish me a good weekend and I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to hurt them immediately after that. I was going to wait for them to die but I don‚Äôt think I can go on longer, there‚Äôs a shotgun in my house and it seems like the best getaway option. I don‚Äôt feel loved but at the same time I haven‚Äôt brought myself to end it because i‚Äôm scared i‚Äôll hurt someone. Everything is just too much, i‚Äôm not doing it tonight but it‚Äôs going to happen this year.",0
I went to a massage parlor where I'm pretty sure an unprotected act has led to me contracting HIV. I was in denial when I got flu like symptoms thinking it was the flu. In the interim I did not have sex with my partner but I think she's come down with it too. Why the fuck should I not end it right now? There is no coming back from this,0
"I‚Äôm thinking that when I get home today, I‚Äôm going to take every pill in my pill bottle of ritalin and talk to my partner for the small amount of time I‚Äôll have left. I‚Äôm sick of everything.",0
"For some reason my insecurities have been super intense lately as I lay here these words keep repeating. Fat, useless ,uneducated, LAZY I‚Äôve never felt this empty and emotionless, Today I didn‚Äôt even smile once all I could feel was I‚Äôm exhausted and kept staring off into blank space I don‚Äôt understand why My brain has decided I don‚Äôt deserve dopamine or Serotonin. What the fuck have I done to deserve to be this fucking empty I dont even feel good enough to call myself hot I feel physically sick just thinking about someone else having to touch me. I haven‚Äôt wanted to drink alcohol so bad until today my past addictions or vices I should say are trying to creep inside me again the only reason why I think I‚Äôm strong enough to say no to it is because I have someone important to me keeping me very grounded.",1
"I've been doing the only thing I'm capable of to hold myself in place at this point, which is doing everything I can to ignore it all. My feelings, my life, the dread that comes every single fucking night. I've been overeating to the point of getting sick. I've been spending days and more days barely taking care of myself, and just existing in my home, from which I barely leave for days on end. I've been avoiding this conclusion forever, mostly because I'm so scared of it. I don't think I want to exist. Every single night I try really hard to dream and fantasize about my deepest desires, in a desperate attempt to find a reason to pull myself up and keep going, but lately, I've been giving up so easily. I feel like nothing's is really worth it, and that includes myself. The thought of just ending it keeps coming over and over again, and it's getting harder and harder to fight back. I'm scared. I feel cold and worthless. But what's worse is that I know tomorrow will be exactly the same. I know there are people who love me and do so much for me, and I appreciate every single second they invest on me... But I've been really afraid of the idea that, even tho they try to, they can't really change things or help me in the ways that really matter in the end, like my mental condition, my traumas and the inescapable barrier that is my social class. It's like I'm locked and always will be. And it doesn't seem very hard for me at the moment to believe that I'll end up dying by my own hands at some point.",1
"My parents were always coercive, and I was timid. It was too much for me to compete in a private high school, but my parents forced me to. I was forced to do it. And I entered medical school as my parents wanted. But I hate life that I regret every day by taking classes that I don't even want. But I don't have what I like and what I'm good at anymore. I want to get away from the life I've lived with as a puppet.",0
"That‚Äôs what wrong. I know I‚Äôm in pretty deep depression, my life has changed so flipping much in the last 6 months. My happy-enough marriage has changed drastically, bringing us closer together but presenting other extremely difficult challenges. Announcing that my spouse is transgender, and so is my kid, is trying. I can only imagine what my wife is feeling about everything. I‚Äôve lost nearly my entire family because of these changes, my wife‚Äôs sister has disowned us, her parents are sort of supportive yet very transphobic. I hate that I have had to choose my wife over the family I grew up with, but I‚Äôd make that choice a million times over, no regrets. My mother has been nothing but cruel and evil. Everyone else is too close to her to reach out or keep in my circle. I don‚Äôt know what the point of my post is. I‚Äôm just so down and don‚Äôt want to vent to my wife right now.",0
"Just over a week ago I left a really shitty situation with parents who have treated me pretty awfully for years and I am finally free - however, I'm homeless. I have been staying with friends and I spend some time in crisis accommodation provided by my psychologist after I finally opened up to her about everything they have been doing to me, and it's just been really hard. I'm having trouble getting the legal documents I need to secure a stable living situation, in my country so much of that is reliant on parental confirmation even though I am a legal adult, and I met up with my mum today to try and talk things out with her but I got brutalised and put down and just made to feel really worthless all over again. She couldn't even not be cruel to me after meeting for just one day after not seeing eachother for awhile, so I have decided to go no contact. I feel really helpless. I feel like the systems in place quite literally fuck you over if you have abusive families, needing their birth certificates to verify things. I feel like it has been made near impossible for me to live independently without them but I know I can never go back because they have put me through so much trauma and so many things I know to not be okay and they have no remorse, and I'm never going to put up with that ever again. I really don't want to go on anymore, I feel so weak, I have been trying so hard to get everything in order for 10 days straight and it has amounted to nothing, and I really feel like I have no other choice,",0
I fucking lost at life. Always. Can maybe. Maybe. Scrap by for groceries but I need food more than tampons. Fuck being a woman.,0
"There isn't anything i like about myself. I hate my skin color, i hate my body, i hate how i cant lose weight, i hate how anti-social i am, i hate how dumb i am, i hate my anxiety, i hate how i can make other people laugh but not myself, i hate how lonely i am. There isn't a damn thing i like about myself. Its like when i was being created, i was given all the bad things in life. I just want a new life.",1
"Does anyone have any suggestions for dealing with major depressive? I‚Äôm 20 years old and I‚Äôve had depression since I was around 13. Everyday is a challenge and I‚Äôm at the point in which I feel like I‚Äôm losing myself. My closest friends live in different countries and I‚Äôm emotionally exhausted from holding onto all of my problems without talking about them. I feel like life would be easier to give up rather than fighting constantly with myself, but my family would be distraught over me hurting myself and they‚Äôve done a lot for me so I‚Äôm resorting to telling people on the internet in the hope that someone knows how to deal with dark thoughts and the lack of emotions that I don‚Äôt feel anymore. - Cereal",0
"Before I start I do got to say that I do not struggle with girls becoming interested in me since most of RateMe and many other places rate me at about 7.5-8 out of 10 for a male which is about average. My main problem is keeping their interest in me. A little background on me, I don't have many hobbies,dropped out of HS because of social anxiety and deppression,fathers dead,still living with mother, have no car nor license,and have no motivation whatsoever. So my life's a mess. So compared to most my age I'm lacking in pretty much everything, especially confidence. No friends really, so I'm mostly alone and feel like dying. Thats why I came here, I need advice and need it bad because soon I'm afraid I'm going to hurt myself because this pain keeps breaking me down and down and I don't know where to turn. So any help would be appreciated. I'm just so close to ending it I just need someone to talk to right now.",0
"I have chronic mental illness, no desire to have kids, and little desire to be in a relationship. I feel like I'm holding out until my Dad dies because I know loosing me would break his heart. I anticipate another 5-10 years but am unsure if I should rent and save no money or attempt to mortgage a condo. I want to do whatever would be both comfortable for the time I am living and economically viable for those still here after I go. A few months ago I was really having a hard time and was unsure if I would even make it this far. Medication has helped a lot but I just have little desire to exist for a full human lifespan. I know I am not the only one.",0
He left us and it caused us to lose our house which was my ptsd coping mechanism. I just want to give up. This abandonment pain is deep heavy shit. I should just give up and die cause my own father left me to this horrible fate. God it fucking hurts I cant stop crying my chest hurts. Why do I deserve this fate. Fuck.,0
Alright I‚Äôm done for real. I‚Äôm deleting this account. Sick of people ignoring me,0
I‚Äôm in college and everything is ruined. I‚Äôve failed my maths class for the third time so I‚Äôm excluded from and science and business majors. My gpa is shit. My degree advisor says to major in something in humanities. Aka end up poor and with no job prospects after college. I can‚Äôt even attend next semester because I have no money. I was hit in a car accident on my bike and had to spend my tuition money on it. I also couldn‚Äôt afford insurance. I can‚Äôt get a loan for school so I‚Äôm fucked. There are no other options. I‚Äôve maxed out my credit card for food and rent because I couldn‚Äôt work with a broken leg. I have no friends or family to help me. Therapy is pointless. Hotlines don‚Äôt work. Group therapy doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôve reached out for help like people said. It‚Äôs over. People always say ‚Äútalk to a therapist‚Äù as if everything gets fixed but it doesn‚Äôt. Maybe for your small issues. I‚Äôve never been loved or cared about. I only have myself. Now is the end. I‚Äôve had depression since I was 8. I should‚Äôve expected this. I wish I hadn‚Äôt wasted my time thinking things could get better. I should‚Äôve done this in high school. Goodbye.,0
Instead I'm fucking drunk like the useless little shit i am.,1
our relationship is far from perfect but they give a lot to keep our family afloat and i can‚Äôt hurt them like that. but it physically hurts to exist. i‚Äôve been depressed for years and it has not gotten better. i have nobody to turn to. i just want to hurt myself but i hate the scars from when i used to do that i don‚Äôt know what to do anymore it hurts,0

"Every morning I wake up, REALLY wishing I didn't wake up. Everyday honestly feels SO difficult to get through to the point where I have almost no energy any longer. I cannot find pleasure in anything and the idea of having to do this any longer really makes me lose it. I am so scared to end my own life because I'm worried it won't work and I'll turn out even worse than I already am. I can't handle the loneliness, the isolation, the constant DEMAND to work day in and day out and make money just to pay bills just to feel this fucking awful all day long. No one truly cares about me and they only want to keep me here for their own selfish reasons. Why can't assisted suicide for mental health be legal? I have called crisis line multiple times daily recently and I'm just ready to overdose on fentanyl. &amp;#x200B; I don't know, I just needed to vent. I am scared to do it but I just want everything to be done and over. I just want to sleep peacefully, forever. Please ... I'm begging just make it all stop and put me out of my misery.

I'm doing ok, but if I didn't have this fucking depression I know I'd be doing better. I can't make progress I've tried to force myself but that seems to just make things worse, I also don't have it that bad so I feel like I'm unrelatable. I also try and be as rational as I can but that doesn't help either it just makes me feel like I'm being sensitive and overreacting.",1

"Every year it seems something goes wrong or I'm alone on my birthday. In my twenties it feels like it's such a mundane thing to be upset over not having a good birthday. But I would just like one day where I can be happy, maybe even celebrate a little, because every other day the pit of self-loathing and misery gets a little bigger. I'd like to be able to spend it with friends that actually care about me, that put in more effort than the people you only hear from once a year when they post an apathetic ""happy birthday"" to your feed. I never realized how much not having friends could affect your mental state until I lost the ones I had. I should be happy today, I should be having fun, but instead I've withdrawn to inattentively watch Hulu while I keep thinking of everything I'd like to be able to share with a friend.",0

I sit in my room all day everyday. No job, no hobbies, only one friend that lives a half hour away from me and I don't even drive (pathetic). I want to kill myself, I want this stupid life to end, every single day is the same. I can't even feel positive emotions anymore like happy or excited. All I ever can feel is sad, annoyed, angry, upset, and insecure. I barely even feel empathy. I feel like my brain is wired backwards. I just want, more than anything, for this life to end. The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because I don't want to hurt those close to me, but everyday I pray and hope that some natural cause takes me out so I don't have to continue. My patience is growing thin though and I just don't see any reason to keep going, I'm seriously considering giving up and my life is so obviously pointless I don't think anyone would blame me. If anyone read this -- thank you, I'm sorry for taking up your time with my issues.",1
my school went and fired the two ELSA therapists because apparently they are ‚Äòredundant‚Äô the school made up so many lies about them not helping anyone and that they were basically useless. i was on track to feeling better with my sessions with one of them but now they got fired and ive fallen back down the deep depression and self harm hole again i also have social anxiety and dont feel confident to see the therapist outside of school and i don‚Äôt feel confident talking to my parents. the lady I saw i had known since getting there and i felt comfortable talking to her and now i have no one. i honestly give up with school entirely as if your not feeling very mentally well today and put your head down off u pop for a lovely 24 hour vacation in solitary confinement the ‚Äòlearning hub‚Äô fuck this shit,0

Life is really hard even tho my life is relatively good for now but I am not happy. Everyday I question why I‚Äôm in college hating every second of it. To work for the rest of my life? For what? Why am I so lazy and unmotivated. My least favorite thing about college is the PEOPLE. I just want to stay inside. I had to skip therapy this week because I have too much pointless school work to do.

"For the record, I'm not trying to feel sorry for myself or try to gather sympathy but I'm done. All my life I've let people walk all over, I've always put everyone else before myself, and I've gone above beyond for people. I don't know why people don't like me or be around me. I have gone to therapy for years to better myself and always tried to be the best person I can but it didn't work. I hate myself so much. I am a burden to my parents, very few people care about me and I am a waste of space to be alive. I know my parents will be upset but they will get over it quickly because they have my brother who is extremely intelligent, handsome and very well-liked. My dad will for sure be okay because he had two kids from a previous marriage and one's a doctor about to get engaged and the other owns her marketing agency and is married to a great guy with two beautiful children. I come from a family of overachievers and I have never measured no matter how hard I tried. They are also very attractive people and for some reason, I came out looking so deformed and ugly. I just feel like there is no point in trying anymore. I screw up all the time, I am a huge loser and very few people like me. It's better I do this now than waste another 25 years alone.

She has done so much for me, &amp; I don‚Äôt think I could ever be half as good a mom as she was. When I was in the hospital for pretty much a whole year in tremendous pain, I never even had 1 visitor, but I didn‚Äôt really care that my friends didn‚Äôt visit me for a year, because she never left me and that was more than enough. The past month or so, she‚Äôs been suffering with her own health issues, which have now grown so severe the doctors are almost positive it‚Äôs cancer or ALS. I‚Äôm trying to keep my hopes up that this is just some kind of short term problem, but every day it worsens, the more I can‚Äôt stop myself from thinking about the possibility of life without her.

I don't think there's something on my mind making me worried, I'm just feeling weird inside and I can't pinpoint what's the problem.

So many fucking times I have held the knife over my wrist, had ropes tied to the ceiling and I just couldn't do it. I am not afraid, nor sad. Just.... a walking dead. Though I attempted many times too, but always failed. I'm not sure how many of you feel the same but I just can't do it maybe because I'm curious to find out if there will be a brand new ending. I thought I had my last home cooked meal tonight and was going to end it all now. But ended up getting high off shit again. I wish something good happens for once. They all say life gets better... I really, truly don't see it. All these dreams and fantasies of having something good in my life is always destroyed by no other culprit than myself. Can't wait for myself to be brave enough to end it",0
"I don‚Äôt understand how I‚Äôm feeling and all I can describe it as is numbness but it‚Äôs past that point and I‚Äôve felt like this for a long time, I feel like I don‚Äôt belong to this life like it isn‚Äôt for me. I can‚Äôt see myself in any career, my own family my own little life I can‚Äôt see it , I‚Äôm so disconnected from social interaction I don‚Äôt leave my house much and the sad thing is as much as I hate it I don‚Äôt want to change it I have no motivation I‚Äôm so tired to the point I don‚Äôt see a point on living when I‚Äôm so tired I can‚Äôt do daily life like everyone. What is the point to this life?

"30 days. In 30 days, I will know if I failed a class for the 4th time, I'll know if the only thing I've been looking forward to the past year can actually make me happy, and I'll get paid, so I will be able to afford a gun.

"Fuck anhedonia. I'm tired of people telling me to fake it til I make it; I'm tired of people giving me suggestions that work for a neurotypical person but not for someone with anhedonia.

I've dealt with this shit for too long. I'm tired of it. For years I've felt like I'm already dead. I really wish I could just die already.",0
Where did I fuck up? What did I do wrong? Did I not give you enough sex? Did I give you too much attention? Was I not enough of a challenge? Is our relationship real? Is it real now?

"I hate myself, and I want to die more than anything. People always say it gets better, but how can it get better when you‚Äôre the problem? I don‚Äôt hate life. Actually, I really enjoy life. I love most of the people I meet, and my dog, and listening to music while watching the sunset and looking at the stars and reading books and hanging out with friends and walking outside after it rains and smelling the fresh air and getting to see people smile. The problem is me. I am a bad person and I hate the way I am. Everyday I wake up and feel guilty for being alive and having to subject the outside world to the unpleasantness that i am. I hate getting out of bed and having to look in the mirror and see myself and be reminded that I‚Äôm me. I literally can‚Äôt stand feeling like this anymore. I hate people telling me I need confidence. I‚Äôm clearing missing more than that. I dont think I can ever like myself, and that‚Äôs why I want to die. I want to enjoy life, and all the amazing things it has to offer, but not really. How can I when I‚Äôm literally my least favorite person I‚Äôve ever met?",1

No one even gives me a chance. All they do is bias me and I‚Äôm tired of it. I‚Äôll show everyone what happens when u treat someone like I‚Äôve been treated. No love, just bias. I‚Äôll show them.

"Hi all, I‚Äôve dealt with mild depression most of my life and handle it decently through medication, on and off therapy and CBT. However I‚Äôve had 3 failed shoulder surgeries since 2016 and my shoulder pain triggers relapses into anger, depression, and feeling bad for myself. I can‚Äôt play basketball anymore which I loved, I have trouble holding and playing with my two young daughters as well. When I try something that I can no longer do (our daughter on my shoulders or shoot hoops in the driveway) it usually means I will be down for the rest of the day. I know people deal with much more serious strokes of misfortune than a bad arm but I often spiral into feeling bad for myself and being mad at myself for the basketball plays that led to the original injuries. Does anyone recommend a book, a method of CBT or any advice for me to deal with this better? Thanks in advance, I appreciate reading this sub, this is my first time posting.",0

"Seriously like a 9-5 isnt my forte, I hate kids, I don't have the ability to pursue both my passions and a job, everyone in my life uses me for emotional support but no I'm a downer if I ever do the same.

I think I've honestly had enough living at this point and I dont wanna hate myself anylonger",1
"My heart feels heavy and empty... I don't feel like I am loved and cared for. I don't want to be with someone that has lost their job twice due to drinking on the job. During that time I was talking to someone and my partner was stressed out about and he started to drink more and he lost his job twice because of this and it feels like its my fault that I can't do anything that makes me happy. I don't want to care for someone that doesn't care about my needs, emotional and physically. If I am sick or doesn't feel well, I have to do it myself without someone taking care of me. One time I had a fever and I had to go to work this partner that I am wish was out and never came home, He didn't check up on me and I haven't heard from him. My plans most of the time has to be put on hold because my partner wants to take a nap and I have to be there most of the time. I want someone to love me and not hurt me anymore, I want hugs and kisses and cuddles and being spoiled alittle bit. My partner isnt the right now for me but I havent found the one for me and I am stuck because I am behind on rent and I am trying to built myself up again after going through some stuff of my own.",0
"I wanted to die starting in Jan 2018, but things have only gotten worse. In summer 2018, those fucks on the Suicide Prevention chatroom called the police when I expressed suicidal ideations, so I was kidnapped and sent to a series of hospital-prisons with junk medical staff. I lost my job due to the hospital stay - and my apartment, car, and dog shortly followed. Can't get a decent job because my resume is now all fucked up and I have no connections, and I refuse to go back to miserable jobs that pay horribly. I'd rather die than do that for life. I am about to be sued on $4K debt, and then yesterday I was handed a $6.5K medical bill for treatment that would have been 100% unnecessary had I still had insurance and was able to go to regular check ups. You fucks on the Suicide Prevention line made my life demonstrably worse. You destroyed the mechanisms that kept me going as an independent and self-sufficient human. Now I have nothing and am in a far worse position (logistically speaking) to be dealing with any of this. Right now I'm sort of just waiting until where I'm currently staying kicks me out, which should be soon. After that, it's time to die. But I'll be sure to let the responsible parties know their part in this.",0
"When I am awake my anxiety is there every moment, and it can be overwhelming. I feel my heart beating faster and my breathing becomes a mess, I just feel my whole body feel uncomfortable when I am awake. The only time where I don't feel panic, where I don't feel as much negative feelings, is when I lie in bed and my mind is getting ready to sleep. I don't know how long it takes to fall asleep, but if it took 10 minutes, then those 10 minutes is the best I ever felt in the whole day. I know that its not good to sleep so much, but I understand why some people would choose to sleep a lot when they are depressed. I look forward to that peaceful 10 minutes. I wish I could have that feeling throught the day without needing to fall asleep first.",0
when I feel really fucking negative (actually even if I'm not feeling negative) it takes the slightest thing to make go try to kill myself. an example of this is when in PE I couldn't do any push-ups then I gave up and tried to kill myself. then someone asks me what's wrong: them: what's wrong me: (visibly upset) nothing them: I know there is something me: fine. I'm going to kill myself them: nooo why? me: ... I can't tell them what because they say I'm faking and I'm doing ut for attention so I'm lost. Doesn't help there's a girl at my school who copies me but isn't actually depressed. she says Oh I gOt TeStEd AgEs AgO aNd OnLy JuSt FoUnD OuT but she's been saying she has a depression for years so hmmm.,1
"I've never talked about this with anyone, but I really don't want to live anymore. Because what is the point? Why am I here? I can't do anything useful in my life until I become an adult, I ruin almost everything, I cut a lot and am always worried someone will see the scars. I get confused when I see people genuinely enjoying themselves and having fun. It blows my mind. How are they so happy? How can anyone love themselves? I don't love myself. I'm fact I hate myself. Because I deserve it. What use am I to anyone? The answer is none. I'm not of any use. And you know why? It's because whenever I've tried to be useful I mess it up. So, what's the point? What the point of enduring an existence that I can't seem to enjoy? I haven't been diagnosed with depression, so I'm not going to claim that I have it. But, what other explanation is there? And even if that is the explanation, does it even matter? Does anything really matter? To whoever read this all the way through, (I know this sounds cliche) thank you for reading my scattered thoughts and emotions. I hope you have a good day tomorrow. Update: I haven't been able to talk to my mom as she's kind of having a 'quiet time' day and I don't want to bother her. I also have a question. Would it be unhealthy for her if I talk to her? She has anxiety/panic disorder and although she hasn't had a panic attack in several months I don't want to cause her too much stress. (Sorry I didn't mention this before),",1
"[I'm not seeking any medical advice, just want to know if anyone has had similar experiences] I've just started taking Lexapro for moderate depression and anxiety.

It really feels like there is no point no matter how much I workout and stay fit I don't feel HAPPY no matter what hobbies I pick up I still feel empty. And yet everyone keeps telling me to keep TRYING I dont do think I can try any harder. I take meds and I don't feel any better I'm always in a dark place and I'm sick emotionally lying to myself some people are destined to have a crap life and I'm proof of this.

"Hello. Depression has always been a secondary problem for me, with my main antagonist being severe Harm OCD. But since my relationship ended 8 months ago, I've been stuck in this horrific cycle of absolutely loathing myself, feeling heavy/tired and totally unmotivated to do anything. It's like I'm living in a 2 dimensional world. Nothing in life jumps out and catches my attention like it used to. I used to be quite creative but it's just taken a nose dive. Any work I do is utterly awful and I'm amazed I'm not been kicked off projects (I work freelance). I wake up and I just want to be dead, quite honestly. In fact in the last few weeks I've even found getting out of bed to be a monumental struggle in itself, where I'm almost in tears from the weight of everything. I am getting help with a therapist and am on an SSRI/low dose anti psych. And I've taken their advice seriously in terms of behavioural activation and avoiding staying in bed. I've started cycling again (just done 20 miles today in fact). But I still feel utterly wretched and everything I do is laced with this horrible belief that this is the end and suicide is my only way out of the pain I'm going through. The years ahead fill me with dread (I'm in my 30s). With my Harm OCD I have a huge hatred of myself anyway, but lately things have just got so heavy. I'd just like to know if anybody can relate to my post and has any first person advice? Psychiatrists and therapists always feel so removed from the reality (for me, anyway) - I'd just like to hear from people who know what's like and have helped themselves.",0

She was so happy to talk to me and to get to spend 9 days with me, I just can‚Äôt do that to her. I‚Äôd like that week to be a happy memory after I can do something but I want to be there for my spring break. So I didn‚Äôt take anything or do anything.

I used to binge eat to fill the void or starve myself out of punishment or watch youtube vids to fill the void or got drunk to feel numb or sleep to escape. But none of these things work now fuck,0
"I haven't been diagnosed with depression and I can't bring up the courage to tell anyone how I'm feeling, but I researched and I have all symptoms. I have constant suicidal thoughts and I have a sh problem. And everyday, I keep feeling worse. I feel utterly worthless and stupid and I don't know why. And it's really hard to type this post because I've never opened up this much to anybody. I have felt this way for a long time (like, a few years) and I really want to know what's wrong with me. I almost never enjoy my life anymore and I want to give up but I'm scared of hurting family members. I always act so happy and cheerful around them and I don't want them to find out the truth. Can someone give me an answer?",1
"Everyone hates me at first sight, and they dont give a fck about me when i need them. Sometimes i could be of use but its just fucking sometimes, when its not ""sometimes"", they dont fucking need me. They dont give a fck about my feelings. All they care about just to get rid of me even tho i dont know wtf i did wrong. They always ignore me like im worse than pile of shit. Acutally almost no one remembers my fucking birthday if it wasnt for facebook bday reminder. I cant even get a therapist or whatever. Plz tell me the easiest and painless way out.",0
Now I don‚Äôt wanna be put on a FBI watch list or anything but my depression has been getting so bad Iv been getting more and more angry. Having no one to talk to adds on to this anger so I en up just bottling it up and I feel like just one day I may physically hurt someone. I don‚Äôt want to believe me but I just feel like that it may happen due to just lack of communication with my feelings.,0
I used to be super emotional and negative but now I'm less emotional and more apathetic and sometimes it feels like I'm just there. Like just living and breathing. Like it feels almost spacey. I'm also super lazy and procrastinate hardcore. idk if it's possible for me to still have depression especially since I don't get severe sadness anymore and rarely cry. I'm I just something else?,1

What would happen if one day i just didn‚Äôt come out of my room? I feel so helpless. I‚Äôm stuck in a cycle of wanting to fucking kill myself, but realize I cant.

Everyone hates me and they‚Äôve began to stop hiding it. I know it‚Äôd relieve everyone if I just died. Only question is, how should I do it?

I wish I had a reason to stay and I wish I didn‚Äôt have to, but life never gets better and I have to at this point.",0
"let me start off by saying that I hate my best friend sometimes not all the time. The basic reason is because she's so perfect and I feel like such a waste and piece of shit when I see her. I'm 16 and a sophomore in high school. We met last year as freshmen and I had never had any friends before so I immediately just accepted her. She was 13 when we met so she started kindergarten early and skipped a grade. then there's me who's two years older but nothing compared to her. She gets straight A's, takes all AP and honors classes, made VARSITY softball as a freshman (age of a 7th grader), got the lead roles in all the theatre shows, and just has a perfect life. Then there's me who doesn't have the best home life. I've tried telling her I can't sleep over because I need my meds and for other reasons. But then she just tells me ""oh everyone feels sad sometimes. You don't need those stupid pills."" Or if I tell her that it's my anxiety and ADHD pills she is like ""everyone has some form of ADHD. Have you seen everyone who can't pay attention? Those pills don't do anything"" I'm very reluctant to end our friendship because I don't have any other friends. Also my Mom has gotten really close with their family and I can't end the friendship beacuse that would be awkward. I feel like this is toxic though. Idk maybe it's just cause I'm not good enough I feel like shit.",1
"Hey everyone, This is so weird that a Reddit board exists for this, but hey it does. I'm a 31 year old, who generally has a lot going for him on paper (good job, partner, lots of friends, supportive family, health, etc). With the job, there is one caveat, I don't know what I'm doing. For context purposes, I'm an accountant and have been one for almost a decade now. I was the kid who studied his butt off in school with the expectation that would pay off in the form of a good job, success etc. I was also one of those people that thought he was better than others, where deep down I wasn't. Really, everybody is special and unique in their own ways. Anyways, what I'm getting at is I feel I've put a lot of bad energy out there and it's all culminating into one big disaster over the past few months. That disaster being the realization that the skills that I say I have on paper I don't actually have in real life (somehow miraculously I got by the past 10 years) and now I don't know what to do. Over the past few months I haven't been sleeping, barely getting anything done at work and overall feel like the end is near. I've had suicide ideation since I was a 15 coupled with worrying about death in general. Anyways, not sure what I expect to get out of posting this, but just wanted to share my situation. I do want to live deep down, there are just so many uncertainties and realizations about myself that scare the living shit out of me.",0

I living in a third world country where people better working their ass off to feed their mouth than thinking for their own feelings. I was born in a urban family and have got a lot of traumas and hatreds duo to unfortunate childhood but I was strived to have a decent education and have tough myself a lot about psychology. Recently I've aware of my depression being more serious cause I started develop and think about suicidal thoughts more often. I told my parents that have trouble in my brain and it affected my study but nobody cares and said I was crazy wtf?? So I decided to tell my aunt who is a physician that I got trouble in my brain but she disappointed me by saying you should stop overthinking and prepare for your future??? Am so messed up right now fuck fuck fuck.,0
I want to die simple as that. I don‚Äôt want to do this anymore. My life has been a fucking shit show since I was 5. People are only in my life because I help them. I‚Äôm that person who will give you the fucking shirt off my back. Do I have anyone in my life who would do that for me? No Right now I‚Äôm practically waiting for my nonverbal 3 year old who has autism to finally say she loves me and then I‚Äôll check out. That‚Äôs the only thing I‚Äôm living for. When I told people that they called me selfish. ‚ÄúPeople love you‚Äù ‚Äúthink about your kids‚Äù ‚Äúif you do it I‚Äôll never visit your grave‚Äù. Why would it take for me to die for people to start showing love for me? Honestly my kid will be better off without me. They don‚Äôt deserve to have such a fucked up mom. And I‚Äôm not being buried. I want to be cremated and thrown away. So I don‚Äôt really need visitors. I SHOULD WANT TO DIE WHEN IM READY AND IM FUCKING READY,0

"When I'm at work, I talk, laugh, and hide behind my shield. When I'm with family, I'm a little more vulnerable, but I'm mostly still silent about the things that are working hard against me to bring me down. However, when I'm alone...that's when it hits me. When my kids aren't home and I'm left to my own devices, that's when I'm the most afraid. It's not that I don't think anyone would miss me, it's the fact that I don't honestly care if they would or wouldn't. I feel like if they knew the extreme pain and mental anguish I'm in from the events my life has drug me through, they would understand my want for release. The constant cheating of exes, the constant deception and pain from being tossed away over and over again. The uselessness I feel of getting out of bed because the same vicious cycle awaits me every single day of my life! I'm tired. I'm tired of giving myself to others, putting myself out there and making myself vulnerable, just to wash, rinse, and repeat a thousand times more. Is it time for me to go? Does it matter?

"I really cannot do this anymore. It's like my suffering has spread onto those I love and I'm at a point where I can no longer put on a fake smile. I can no longer pretend that I'm okay because I'm not. I hate seeing my friends and family hurt for me and it breaks my heart seeing them feel so helpless. My life is such a failure and I've already ruined it so much that there's literally no point in going on. I fall asleep crying every night because I realized that I'm the problem here and my existence only makes the lives of others worse. People keep telling me how much they love me and how much I have to live for and while that does mean something to me, it's not enough to make me want to live. With my existence, I hurt people and with my death, I'll hurt people, so what's the point? At least if I die eventually the hurt will begin to fade (or so I hope). I just want the people I love to live a life without worries or hurt and all I do is hurt them. I have 2 more weeks to finish this quarter of school. Before I decide to end my ""wonderful"" life I just want to finish this one quarter, not that I'm going to achieve anything. I just want to push through these last 2 weeks but even that's been extremely difficult.

I have chronic pain that is awful the last few years, relationship problems that he won't work out with me because he chooses to be stubborn and stand offish. I don't know how much more of life I can handle without cracking and shattering. It's been mostly bias and loneliness with a few brief happy moments.

I'm just struggling in general. I don't know how to cope anymore. Journaling helps for a few minutes. Crafting helps for a few minutes. Standing in the sun helps for a few minutes.

"I tried making progress on my thesis from a few weeks back but it has been so difficult, not just in a mental state. Ever since I got depression, I have the hardest time focusing on stuff. Even if I tried to focus on doing stuff I enjoy doing, I can't do it for long, my head gets dizzy. I can't read lines in a book without getting my vision blurry and end up forgetting which line I was supposed to read. And I also have the hardest time to recall short term and long term memories. These days I would have lunch and half an hour later I would ask myself ""wait, did I eat lunch today ? or was it yesterday ? Do I need to eat again ?"". I can't tell which day of the week is it. I currently don't have the two things that are absolutely crucial for my productivity, which is concentration and memory. I try to bring myself up but it is so freaking hard when my body can't respond back. I guess now I just have to do what I can and try to brace myself for tomorrow, for I am sure to be destroyed during my defense tomorrow. I am scared sh\*tless because I know one of the professors can be ruthless and heartless, can only imagine how heartbreaking it will be tomorrow. I want to pat myself on the back and say ""Its okay, its gonna be fine. You've done your best against all odds. If you fail tomorrow its fine, you can try again next time"" but I can't bring myself to do that, and I am scared and I feel alone. I just feel like I need a hug.",0

I recently had to go to the hospital per my therapist (or get IVCd). That was a month ago and nothing has gotten better. No meds have helped and I still find myself planning my death. My psychiatrist prescribes me ambien and I've googled the lethal dosage. I have more than enough. Part of me wants to live but the part that wants to die is bigger. Sadness is like an ocean. Sometimes you swim but right now I'm drowning and I'm not sure there is any coming back from it. Part of me wants to do it in my birthday but I fear that will just devastate my family even more.

"For the context, I'm 20 years old, soon to be highschool graduate. So here is what's going up in my mind right now. No matter what i write up here it's surely happened before. What is there in being your own individual if your entire life is just a copy paste of someone else's? My decisions won't matter in the long run, because my life is to insignificant. And year by year I feel my presence getting weaker and weaker Sooner or later in gonna start working in some industry i don't want to work in and I will feel happy.

I want to be special but I'd rather watch YouTube than learn or train something. My school will be ending in 2 months and I feel weirdly nostalgic thinking about it. Maybe I'm proud of my achievements, which I don't even remember, or maybe I'm happy I'm in a situation I have brought myself into. Maybe I feel like my movie is ending and i need to plan our Mr finishing move. Like I said, I will be finishing highschool and I feel like it's an appropriate ending for me. Get a certificate, be happy from getting it, and ends it all. It will be fulfilling. All of my life has been waiting for this moment to happen, but I don't want another chapter of my story.

My throat now burns and I feel super weak (head rush from the nicotine) so I plan to relax, and when I can move again, grab my knife and end it all.

I have a boyfriend, my first real one, but I'm so afraid to lose him, that he choses someone else when he gets the chance like my last dude. I'm so lonely. Even my cat runs away from me when I cry. Please, someone just talk to me",0
"It's not a competition, I'm not promoting it, but I've had one of the worst 24 hours where I've been knocked down, felt suicidial, picked myself back up, got knocked down again, felt suicidal again, picked myself back up again, and then it's happened all again. I've actively thought about killing myself because of three different bad things that's happened in the last 24 hours and right now it would be helpful to hear that others are also doing the same exhausting routine too.",0

Total sessions: 10 days Sessions per day: 2 15 mins each session with one hour gap in between. I‚Äôm not on any medication at the moment. I was on fludacs for a while.

"Ive been feeling sad for unknown reasons for a year now. Where you'll wake up and feel empty all of a sudden and cry for no reason. Then there will be nights where i'll full on cry and hit my self till i feel numb. There's times where i tried overdosing different medicine. I opened this stuff to my parents and said that i shouldnt feel that way because im living in a comfortable life they had to rant out and say when they were young life was harder and stuff. That i dont have the right to feel this way because they to were pressured back then. Then my step mom said that i should just die and to tell my real mom that she wished i was never born. I also opened about me being stressed over school and how i want to give up. My step mom said that i shouldnt go to school anymore. Its just really triggering for me, i really want to die rn. The onlynthing that is holding me back is my bf, he said that i should fight and all. Idk whats hsppening to me someone help.",0
"After being in such a long, unhealthy and abusive relationship, I have been dating again. At first I was optimistic. At this point, after so many dates that went nowhere, I don't think I will ever find someone to be with for the rest of my life. I haven't felt like I really clicked with anyone. The men who seem to have the right qualities aren't interested in me. Nobody normal is interested in dating a disabled person, even when it's an invisible disability. Even being attractive can't overcome that. I have no career because I got sick. Nobody wants to deal with that. I'm tired of seeing everyone else in happy marriages with families. It just reminds me that I'm not good enough and won't ever be. I'd rather just die than be alone for the rest of my life. I have a lot of great qualities and a lot of love to give. Just no one to share any of it with. I feel like today might be a bad day for me. Hopefully I can keep myself from ending it all.",1
"Don‚Äôt usually drink, but do you ever feel so useless and depressed you just want to drink yourself into oblivion?",1
"first of all let me say i dont have a problem with myself, im good the depression isnt about anything personal. my thing is more existential. human beings have made great leaps in the last hundred years which when you think about it is just a speck on calendar. as far as movies and music to me it just seems like every song has been written and every tvshow/movie has been made and we as a species are just kind of going through the motions. to add to this is this innate sense of self destruction that humans have, its hard for me to put into words but it seems like we have come to do what w need to do and our time is probably up. i mean how many times can we see the same movie (franchise reboots anyone) or the same songs as we run out of original melodies on top of other factors such as a.i and world friction. to me it seems like we are just tapering towards an end and id rather it not be som long drawn out song and dance. im not sure if that makes sense but thts how i could verbalise in a way my feelings",0
If nothing changes by the end of the yearI've decided to kill myself. I can't live like this anymore. I'm so tried.

If nothing changes by the end of the year I plan on killing myself before I turn 20. IM SO TIRED I WANT IT TO END I WANT RELEAF,0
"holy shit things went bad fast. Last year I went into deep depression, however I recovered over the summer and things were seemingly looking up. I got a job, my grades were good and was hanging out with friends regularly. However the past two weeks things have went to absolute shit. My parents decided they wanted to try some ""parenting"" and decided I spent ""too much time on video games"". Even though I really only played 1-2 hours a night. It was one of the main ways I interacted with my friends as well. After that they decided that my phone was distracting me so it was confiscated as soon as I got home from school. Then they decided to take my door off the hinges to look in on me more. The worst part is i don't even know why they are doing all of this. My grades were good, A's and B's and in 6 AP classes while working 20 hours a week and maintaining a social life. Everything was going so good. Now I get home and feel empty and alone. I can't even cry in privacy. then they have the audacity to ask ""Honey whats wrong, why are you sad?????"". I just dont understand.",0
"Make enough money. I'm fit, and pretty healthy. Got friends and family and a long distance gf who I know all care about me. Still feel like killing myself every day halfway through the work day like clockwork. Get home and stare at the wall while drinking a beer. Never want to talk to anyone or hang out with anyone. I've got several potential methods in mind, haven't picked one. Day in, day out, it's all the same. What's the point of it?",0
"I dont want to call myself depressed, because I am happy sometimes I don‚Äôt want to say I‚Äôve been emotionally biasd, because it‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt as bad as others and I don‚Äôt remember most of it I don‚Äôt want to say my dad left, because I still talk to him but I haven‚Äôt seen him in almost a full year I don‚Äôt want to say I have anxiety, because I don‚Äôt have panic attacks anymore I don‚Äôt want to say I used to cut, because I only did it for a few months I don‚Äôt want to make people mad because my problems aren‚Äôt that bad, so I just keep my mouth shut. Until someone asks, then I let loose. Yet, it‚Äôs still not bad enough to be anything worth while....",0
Best part about the winter is that the water is so cold here. I‚Äôve thought about jumping in and never coming back. I‚Äôve thought about this probably at least once a day since it got cold out. It‚Äôs a spot where other people have disappeared. Maybe if I take a bunch of Xanax or something that will help mess me up so much that I die easier. I‚Äôve written suicide notes before but I go back and read them and think they sound stupid so this time I‚Äôll keep it brief. 32 years I tried. I held on for my mom and brother but I don‚Äôt have any fight left in me. I‚Äôm tired. I just want to rest forever. I‚Äôm sorry to everyone but you will all be fine in the grand scheme of things. Be grateful that you are not me. I am not essential to anything.,1

I know Im not the only one with this type of story but I need to share. At 50 years old I have alot going, full time musician and always busy. In other words my life is very good but I feel finished. I'm tired and still suffer from depression. I don't drink or do drugs. I work out almost every day, have had therapy and cannot shake what goes on in my head. I didn't kill myself because of our 23 year old son otherwise I would've been gone long ago. If anybody reads this I'm just sharing my thoughts and I too go through life not wanting to be here.

College just makes me very depressed I feel like I can‚Äôt succeed in anything and that I‚Äôm wasting money. 4.) The factor that people hate each other for no reason.

"I know that a lot of people say that they lost their younger years to anxiety and depression. There is no doubt that I've definitely lost a lot of years to those same things, but I feel like a large portion of my life has been wasted in school. Of course there is a lot of useful things schools teaches that can be applied in every day life, but school has become the worst part of my day, which is especially troubling since it takes up such a large part of it. And after school, I'm just so drained and it makes me so sad to be alive. You'll probably have it in most school systems regardless of country, but American school are just such a shitty environment for people who have mental issues. How am I even supposed to properly deal with these issues when I'm constantly bombarded with all this schoolwork? How am I supposed to experience life and enjoy it when I'm trapped in an environment that worsens my mental health and anxiety? It's my last year of high school, but I still can't help but feel like I would be happier having dropped out. Realistically, the long term would look worse, but school environments are so toxic a lot of the time. The pressure to conform is just so strong and I don't know how other people feel, but it almost makes me hate being different, it makes me want to be ""normal"" I'm just venting a little. I don't know if this would really make sense to other people, tbh I'm kinda fucked up mentally right now cause school is a bitch. Thx for reading :)",0

"I made a throwaway because I'm starting to suspect people I know have seen my previous posts. I feel empty; the sort of empty where I feel as if I'm an intruder of my own body and mind. For a good 3 years, I stopped living. I'm merely existing by now. I know by this point that I likely won't live to have children. I've destroyed my system enough with mixtures of starvation and purging to probably have children at this point. I think I'll likely die by my own hands. The only things that actively stops me is maybe the fact I don't want paramedics or my family finding my body. It sounds sick and conceeded but I sometimes think I'm too fat to be found. (Haha ironic) I made a deal with myself that I would reach a certain weight and then slowly kill myself via starvation or exhaustion. I know how painful that could be but I deserve it. I'm a poor excuse for a human being. I've tried speaking with family and friends. I don't want anyones sympathy even though I'm venting about this.",1

Everyday is a struggle to get through the school day and it just keeps getting worse and worse I don‚Äôt think I can even do this anymore. I just want it to end I want to die. I have markings on my left hand from where I have cut myself when ever I feel this feeling that I am stupid, I am useless, why am I even here I am just a waste of space.

I dont wanna live anymore, and I can‚Äôt even see a doctor even though I have the legal right to one there is none available and walk in clinics are useless.

"To my childhood self, Fuck you for being an effeminate little boy that made you such an easy target. You could have interesting in ANY FUCKING WAY yet you had to be just a fucking vanilla ass piece of shit in the corner for people to show and shoot shit at. You thought it would make you into a stronger, more interesting person, but it just made you more quiet, more boring and easier to ignore. Fuck you for remembering the physical and emotional bias your dad did to you and your family. Fuck you for letting your mom run her little experiments on your body like some sort of lab rat. Fuck you for speaking out about your suffering when you did. Going to the adults really improved your life and didn't just make your biasrs hate you more while they got off with slaps on the wrist, huh? Fuck you for remembering your childhood, especially only the bad parts. I'm 25 now and am just now experiencing these again, and you have no idea what sort of hell I'm in getting these vague memories again and again. This is YOUR FAULT! I want you dead like how I want me dead. I want you to suffer way more than you ever had before just so you won't survive and I don't have to experience it anymore.

Anyway 2 glasses in I‚Äôm trying to find somebody to hang out with, texting all my friends that are nearby and everyone was busy. I felt so lonely, painfully lonely, and I started hating on myself. I‚Äôve learned to really love myself the past few years but lastnight my dark side emerged and I wanted to hurt myself. I took a knife to my leg and just started cutting, something I haven‚Äôt done since high school.

I‚Äôve limited myself by a few moments of weakness but I‚Äôm trying to forgive myself. I just had to get it off my chest.

Hey you good I just say yeah everyday the same to the point that I just live I‚Äôm living but not living I know this is just some rant that goes no where.

"Nowadays people are starting to embrace body positivity and are learning to love who they are. So why can‚Äôt I? Every time I look in the mirror all I see are flaws. My stomach bulges out too much, my face is fat, my acne is ugly, I need to shave, my teeth are yellow, my butts too small, etc. Why can‚Äôt I see the good in myself? My biggest insecurity is my stomach. I can‚Äôt help to think that I‚Äôm fat even though I have an average BMI at 5‚Äô5‚Äù , 140 with playing a sport/working out every day. I think this insecurity sort of stems from everyone around me being stick thin. This one girl in my grade keeps saying how ‚Äúfat‚Äù she is when she‚Äôs half a foot taller than me and weighs less. I know that shouldn‚Äôt bother me but it does. I also am a gymnast and seeing everyone around me be thin and look good in leotards makes me feel awful. After eating a lot, I can‚Äôt help but be so mad at myself later for putting on so much weight, but sometimes I just can‚Äôt help it. I like food. It‚Äôs gotten to a point where my lunch is just a granola bar and I‚Äôm just hungry throughout my day.

I haven't been going to my college classes, I've been overeating out of stress, I haven't contacted my girlfriend much, and I feel like killing myself is all I'm really good for. If I drop out or get kicked out, my family will force me to get a job. I've worked before and had a panic attack at least every day. Instead of going to class I've been drinking and smoking to help deal with the emptiness. I genuinely don't think I'm worth shit. I'm not gonna be able to provide for my girlfriend or make my family happy. Why not kill myself? It would solve all my problems.",0
"It's going all good, I'm feeling happy and all of a sudden I feel depressed. Idk what to do!? I am hating myself right now! Why does this happen? How do I deal with it?",1
"just noticed this. Why I don‚Äôt have any lifelong friends from elementary or middle school like everyone else does, or why I never had a boyfriend from my hometown of state. I don‚Äôt have the same humor, mindset, hobbies or interests of these fucking people but I won‚Äôt conform to them either. Don‚Äôt even sound like any of them. Living in the Bay Area makes it even worse cause there‚Äôs this new cancer generation of tech assholes over here. Everyone‚Äôs the same..fake No ones kind or genuine anymore Never felt comfortable here and now it‚Äôs below fucking 0 Want to kill myself, I‚Äôm never getting out of here",0
"So today at work i had a mental breakdown, i cant stop feeling so.... sad! Suddenly my suicide thought keep pop up in my head and i keep falling apart. I never smoke before but for some reason i wanted to so bad ..... I was crying and cutting myself continuously but the sad thing it no one care at all. My coworker never ask me why i start smoking or so did my parent. I laughed at myself for being so stupid....that i thought they might care about me. Hah ! Im a mess right? Now i cant stop thinking about dead. To be honest i feel like sometimes even the internet care about me more then my own parent ! I cant love myself anymore because im"" a accident and the only reason that made everyone suffer "" ...... I never wanted to die tho. But my life suck and i "" just making reason so i can get my way out """,0
"My life is on repeat. I wake up and do the same things over again every single day. I don‚Äôt have any friends, I have no one. I feel so empty and alone. I guess it‚Äôs another on of these nights for me when I just sit and stare into nothing and think about how crap my life is. Seeing everyone happy having a great time meanwhile I am home. 18 years old about to graduate. Don‚Äôt even know if I want to go to college. I always think about ending it when it comes to that time.",0
Every time I start to build a life it gets ripped apart in a few days. When I relapsed on alcohol everything goes to shit. I could be going to jail. Life always gets worse. I want to die. I'm 30 and it gets worse and worse and worse. Sure there's small spaces of joy but it's not worth it. I want to slit my wrists vertically. I just want to end this suffering. I've been in love and I've had some good times. But I don't want to go through this life any longer. I also have a physical disability. I'm just a little scared if death but we are going to die either way. I'm scared of pain but I just want this life to end.,0
People say bad decisions don't always make someone a bad person. I really feel like that isn't true in my case. I imagine myself feeling eternally shitty and a waste of a life. The hurt I have caused my SO has made me feel like I have no true identity. I wish I didn't have BPD. I wish I could have been better. I can wish and wish but that will never fix things. My body and mind feel useless I can distract myself with friends but I feel so distant from the world. I am filled with guilt. The worst part is knowing my SO has forgiven me and I can't help but think they may not want to be with me for much longer. I would crumble and disappear without him. I am filled with so much pain... pain that I deserve to feel. I wish I could disappear but thinking about dying is horrifying. If the world goes on just the same without me. If I fade into a distant memory to those who I know. I know I need more external help. But no amount of therapy will rid me of the thoughts I have about myself. I fear I will never grow from this. It all seems so dark and temporary.,1
"As the title says, I cut myself for the first time yesterday. It was only 2 swipes, but it feels like a huge step back and I don't know what to do. I don't have a therapist and I can't talk to my parents about it because they think its not as serious as it is. I just don't know where to go from here.",0
"If you guys want the story as to why, there's an earlier post I made about my story. Though not hugely dramatic, it is too much for me to bear. What should I do? I hate myself, I don't have friends anymore and I hate my life. I've just thought about taking a loaded shotgun and ending things just like that, but... I'm afraid to die. What do I do?",1
"2020 is kicking my ass so bad. I got laid off in November, and a pregnancy wouldnt allow me to work until now. I got the call that im going back to work starting Saturday, but whats the use? Unemployment didnt pay enough to make rent and bills, social assistance wont help me BECAUSE im recieving Unemployment, and i was given the ""you have 14 days to pay your rent or i start the eviction process"" notice from the landlord. After waiting for a late payment of Unemployment to come in, and my husband and i taking everything of value to us (PS4, Switch, and even his guitar) to the pawn shop, we're a solid $60 short on rent with no income in sight for the remaining days we have to pay. I put my name out for emergency commissions as i figure people might go for it, but in all honesty, no one has. Another bomb dropped on me today was that this ""flu"" my 3 year old daughter has had for a few days now is actually Scarlet Fever. Who gets scarlet fever? Is this the 1800s? What happens if my newborn son catches it from her? Is this year the year i lose a child and face my biggest and deepest fear? Idk man. I just wish this year would stop kicking my ass...i just needed to tell the world.",0
"I know that life eventually gets better.. But all I can think about recently is how much I want to die.. I went to the park a few weeks ago and there is this giant bridge there that leads across the river and I could only think about jumping off of it.. I would never actually do it because I know it would destroy my family, but it‚Äôs just so hard. So hard to pretend to be happy. I‚Äôm just so tired of being a fuck up and I feel worthless and I just don‚Äôt know what to do. Obviously I need a therapist, but I can‚Äôt afford one.",1

This week I‚Äôve been crying a lot and the thought of food makes me feel nauseated. I havent been in to work. How can I get myself to get up and try to live my life?,0
"I've never written on reddit before. I'm not sure what I'm expecting from doing this. I guess a feeling of release. I've been suppressing my feelings to put on a show for everyone else. That despite this year bringing me the hardest time of my life, I'm being strong, I'm being resilient. But the truth is I'm not. When I interact with people, I'm the bubbly, smiley persona that is expected of me. But as soon as I'm alone, my face is blank, my emotions are numb and all of the feelings I'm pushing down resurface. My expression completely changes when I'm alone. Im a different person. A person no one knows. But the facade is starting to fall apart. I dont want to do this anymore but no one cares about the girl behind the mask..",0
"everyone has someone...and im just here, alone what's wrong with me? i try my best i just dont want to be alone anymore... living like this, is not really worth it...",0
I been thinking about religion. Like if you believe their is a God. Well he or she since God created man and women. Well God is the only super hero. I started to believe in a God since DINOSAURS. Even I try to pray to a God to take me back to 1994. Even my life is going no where. I have a mental illness called schizophrenia where the brain cognitive is dysfunctional. Hallucinations and hearing voices that arent their. Which makes me think solipsism. But hell im no God when I believe a God. Since I didnt create clouds trees or even DINOSAURS. I admit mental illness has no path of success. Even I want to give up to pray for a new one cause im getting old. If I could live forever I would cause dying isnt going to get better. It only gets better to a human that isnt God. Don't you think if their is a God that he or she would remember everything?,0
"My mom wont stop criticizing the movies and YouTube I watch only for the swearing.. I'm 20 years old.. they really help me with my depression. Especially YMS, movie channels, Michael Reeves.. I swear in private A LOT but never in front of my parents. I just think it's funny how THATS the problem when I feel like fucking garbage... not when i was assaulted (groped) not when i came home crying when i was bullied mercilessly.. not when I cry to her that nobody loves me (literally says I'm being manipulative when I do and I'm doing it for attention) not when I slashed my thighs when she told me that if I didnt graduate college I would be a loser that relys on welfare homeless and a drug addict. Not when she has thrown shit at me when I have trouble getting out of bed in the morning.. no swearing is the problem...",0
"Why can‚Äôt I do what I need to do? I remember telling my final therapist how I‚Äôd sit paralyzed while my mind screamed at me to do things, and she said I just had to do them. It was one of those things I‚Äôve been told that stings to this very day. Is this paralysis some internal weakness that I do have control over? If so, how the hell does this work because I can‚Äôt figure it out? I wouldn‚Äôt have gone to see someone if I‚Äôd have known they‚Äôd told me what they did. I came to them for help. Was what they gave me the only help there is? Is this my fault? Or do I even have a choice being like this?",0

Yea. I‚Äôm ready for the ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just a kid‚Äù. Idgaf. I want to go. My mind and body is screaming for a way out of this fucking horrible mindset of myn. Im a dumbfucking stoner with a stepdad who literally makes me fear to go downstairs. I sit in my room all day and hope that I just fucking die. My mom Dosent fucking care jack shit about me. My step dad gets pissed off over nothing. And leaves for 8 months. And I swear by this saying those 8 months are the happiest months I ever have. My stepfather almost choked his father out when he was 16 and said he wishes he did it. Which makes me scared to say anything to him. My mother knows I don‚Äôt like him and don‚Äôt like being near him but she Dosent care. I was bullied for nearly my whole elementary school years and I was having suicidal thought from the start of grade 3 or 4. And that‚Äôs just not okay in the eyes of anybody. I currently just took 10 pills and hoping I black out. I have one friend. Who I made when I was forced to move back to my old house. Him and I bonded over stupid and racist shit. And now he‚Äôs like a brother to me. I wish he didn‚Äôt have to put up with my bullshit. I love him like a brother and all. But I feel that he would get over it soon enough. I feel bad for people who have to deal with me. And I just want all this pain and suffering of my day to day to fucking end. I want me to end. I want everything to fucking end.,1

"I don't think I'm depressed. Not really sure how it works, but I'm kind of done If that makes any sense. This past semester of school has just been, weird, any time I get an assignment I feel overwhelmed, even though it's no different from any previous semester. I failed my first math test, I haven't started my senior project, behind in everything else. I want to get caught up, but I just have no desire to do anything. I live at home (community college) and have a life I'm sure many others would kill for, but still. As cringe as it sounds, I've been pointing our .357 at my skull and dry firing it. I hate the idea of my family and friends having to deal with the fallout, but I really can't see a future for myself. I'm not going to do anything but I thought I post because why not.",0
I guess you could say it's to the point where it's affecting my attendance at work. So far I have the days off but I'm about to run out. Has anyone ever been treated for fatigue and it helped their depression? Maybe the fatigue is what causes the depression?,0
If I have time to think then all I want to do is commit suicide. If I watch movies or play games or something similar that is not boring to me I am fine. My problem is at work it‚Äôs an 8hr suicide thinking session,0
"I‚Äôm pissed off at my depression. It comes and goes and every time it comes back, IT‚ÄôS WORSE. I hate how I talk to a therapist every two weeks and I‚Äôm not diagnosed with depression. I cry every night and feel so alone. I‚Äôve isolated myself from others in order to heal. I go to the gym 4 days a week, I eat healthy, I try to do some chores and self care too. I don‚Äôt know if I need meds because apparently I show signs of willingness so I don‚Äôt need them. I‚Äôm pissed that I am consumed by chronic sadness every day and night, 24/7. I‚Äôm also pissed that I have no supportive people besides my parents and cousin. Perhaps I‚Äôm ungrateful. I‚Äôd rather end it all tbh. Nothing in this life is exciting and at 21, life should be fun, exciting, wild, laid-back, etc. As a young woman, I should be excited for what‚Äôs to come. I should be excited for having a wonderful life but I am not. I absolutely hate my self and my life. Nothing is helping, not even talking to others. The only person who can help me is me and nothing is working.",1

"I literally broke down crying and asked to go home, another nurse was watching me while I was crying saying he wanted to keep me longer, as I kept saying I wanted to go home and He said I was ""wasting his time"" by making him watch over me while I asked to cry for a while before leaving. I've never been through anything like this especially when in a hospital and when I was so weak and my chest and throat hurting so much from a panic attack. I just wanted to vent, thank you for reading.",0
"Year ago i‚Äôve survived from a suicide attempts and then i watching the movie Fight Club It‚Äôs motivate me, Hell its even give me a boost of confidence, Huge Confidence, But its never fix my problem which is im too fckin lazy to live in this world.

"Since ""the Event"" my life changed, I became very mentally ill comparing to what was before, now I have this cycle of bad mental states all the time: debilitating anxiety, deep depression, suicidal ideation, every fucking day. It's so hard even to do basic stuff, now I am gonna live? Honestly this is horrible way to live but I am fighting, I am really trying but it doesn't get better. I don't want to die, but I don't know how much longer I can keep going. And what for. I am tired and scared. I don't want to die. But this is not how life supposed to be.",0
"My life is not worth living. I am the most destructive person to myself and the ones I love. Everyday looks the same, I go to school, I work, I procrastinate, I stress, I cry, I sleep, I repeat. Every. Day. Is. The. Same and it gets unbearable. I haven‚Äôt talked to my therapist for 4 month because it doesn‚Äôt help, going inpatient for the 5th time doesn‚Äôt help. Nothing helps. And school makes it IMPOSSIBLE for me to enjoy literally fucking ANYTHING. I NEVER in my whole life felt this depressed, even though I survived an suicide attempt a few years ago, that doesn‚Äôt compare to the depression I am feeling right now and it‚Äôs scary. After all these years of therapy I am doing even worse. I just want to lie in my bed and fall asleep and never wake up again. But I am also to scared that people think I don‚Äôt try enough or that I am lazy so I put on a mask and pretend, smile, make people laugh, pretend, till I come home and completely destroy my mother with my thoughts and depression.

"My father passed away last year. I feel incredibly alone now, he was my go-to person whenever I had a problem. I left my job to take some time off after he passed. I've left two more jobs since then, I just can't handle any of it any more. My gf, who I've been staying with, wants me to leave so she can ""find herself."" I can't blame her really. My father's gf, whom he was with at the time of his passing and for the previous 15 years or so, has already moved on and started dating a guy that I don't think dad would approve of, either. I don't know who to turn to or what to do. I have a little bit of money saved up so I'm not in immediate danger, and I think I've worked it out with my gf to stay here until I find a job? I just don't hold out a ton of hope. Whenever I think of getting another job, most likely in a field I hate anyway (recruiting), I just think ""what's the point?"" Like I really don't have a ton to live for at this juncture. I don't want it to be this way and I just can't seem to figure a way out of it that would give me a good quality of life. It all just feels pointless. I've tried to look up free or low cost therapists in the area, I have a couple numbers but trying to read about state funded mental health care and I couldn't make heads or tails of the webpage. Way too complex.",0

"I don‚Äôt want to die this way, but i think i inevitably will, no one can save me from myself. Everyday takes so much effort to function mediocrely. I want to live but I don‚Äôt think I can change. It‚Äôs just a waiting game. I‚Äôm not depressed enough to want to act on my thoughts, I‚Äôm too scared and I care too much about the people around me. I just want to die and take everyone‚Äôs suffering with me. I want everyone to be happy because they deserve that. I wish there was a way I could sacrifice myself and make everyone better. I‚Äôve had enough of suffering, I can‚Äôt bear to see it. I feel empathy so hard, because of the severe depressive episode I went through a few years ago. I can‚Äôt bear to imagine anyone experiencing that. It breaks my heart. I convinced myself not to die but I‚Äôve never truly felt at peace, life for me is just exhausting attempts at constantly distracting myself from the depressive thoughts that I just can‚Äôt get rid off. I‚Äôve learnt how to cope, but I‚Äôve never been cured. One day when I feel the time is right, when I‚Äôve distanced myself enough from my friends and when my parents have died, it would probably be the time I end my life.",0
I finally decided after several attempts on my life that this will be the last one. Theres an overpass for a busy interstate by my house. The height and speed of the cars should be enough to take me out once and for all. I'm so god damn alone and I feel guilty that people care about me. All i have to keep me going is my dog but I dont think she'll stop me this time. I'm a total fuck up who's ruined every positive thing in his life. I'm 17 and have no future no will to live. It's been this way everyday for over three years. My times come and I'm not afraid to say goodbye anymore.,0
"So I went to a stupid therapist last week because of the self harm and suicide thing with my school. I dont really want help but I was at least hoping for some help with my mental health. That didnt happen, instead I'm going to get tested for autism (asperger's). I dont think that having autism is bad but that's not really what i wanted, I wanted to sort out my mental health and all she did was take down all the things that could mean I'm autistic. I just hate it, I dont get why I was referred to a therapist that specializes in autism. That's not what I need. Sorry if this is offensive. Sorry",0
"Right now as I'm in a taxi going home, I drank 10 pills of antidepressants, wanted to drink the entire bottle and pass out on the road peacefully but couldn't get myself to finish the bottle. My legs are going numb and I'm starting to lose sight in my eyes. Doubt I'll be able to go to work tomorrow because have never drank this much and definitely tried before but couldn't follow through. Somebody might be thinking that I'm doing this because I'm miserable, well maybe you're right. Not because I'm alone( in an amazing relationship for over two years) not because I'm unemployed or broke( working at an amazing position as an HR vice president) not because I have abusive family( they're extremely supportive and I'd give my life for them), even if you have all of those you can still be miserable and not feel happy.

A fake built up to conceal the blackness and horrible person I really am. I can't be happy ever again, everything I put on is just a mask to hide the nothingness. Nobody needs me.

"What started as a week phase(on and off) in September of 2019 has slowly becoming more and more permanent. My eyes feel tired, I feel physically exhausted.

While I dream I feel happy, I don‚Äôt feel weighed down. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm alone. I don‚Äôt feel numb. I went to the school counselor for help last week. All she told me was to tell my mom how I was feeling and go see a doctor. That is the hardest thing I can possibly do.

"I have been bullied and told I was playing the victim card my entire life, nobody wants me to live so why am I still here? I will never find a boyfriend or girlfriend and being broken with a useless set of cards keeps me from being even slightly successful. The American dream is specifically made to benefit the wealthy and powerful. The poor will not make it in this country, suicide rates are already rising and have been for the past 20 years. I try playing games but nothing is entertaining anymore especially when I do everything alone with no visible future. I am literally just living until I am not able to support myself and then I will either die by natural causes or suicide. It feels like nobody wants to support me and I was dealt a useless set of cards from the beginning.",1

"i was perfectly fine until about 9pm last night (i randomly started crying out of nowhere as i was watching a perfectly normal youtube video, although i've forgotten what it was about, but it wasn't anything upsetting or triggering). so i go to sleep at about 10ish and assume that i'll be better when i wake up, but i was wrong. i woke up still depressed and crying again, not wanting to get out of bed or do anything, let alone go to uni and do my work/study. i get up and get ready (although this felt like it took an eternity to do), and go to uni for a while, but i found it really overwhelming. i don't remember what else happened, but i decided to go back home (student flat) and try to take my mind off work even though i can't because the deadlines are coming pretty fast. to think that i was full of energy and ideas 2 days ago is beyond me since i've barely had the energy to get out of bed this morning. i also don't have the energy to cry anymore, so now i'm just empty and wanting to die. also this post doesn't really make much sense, but i'm super depressed and empty that i feel like i can't function anymore",0
"I'm a mid-20s woman with rapid-cycling bipolar II but I'm posting here because I'm asking about antidepressants and how to control my depressive episodes. My moods were under control when I was on lithium and zoloft, but the zoloft (50 mg, so not much) absolutely ZAPPED my sex drive. I would force myself to do it to please my partner (no, he did not coerce me). Aside from that, I felt the best I'd ever felt. No complaints otherwise. Last June, I went off the zoloft and stuck with the lithium and felt fine, but I felt some depression symptoms coming back after a couple months. My anxiety and reactivity increased, but I was still WAY better off than with no meds whatsoever. In December, my psychiatrist recommended an NDRI to help prevent a change in libido. I started wellbutrin (100 mg so again, not much) and it was definitely helping, but now I'm feeling some depression symptoms coming back again. I have spent the last week thinking I'm stupid and pathetic and useless for no apparent reason. My psychiatrist thinks I did better on an SSRI, but the lack of libido was awful and not something I ever want to experience again. I know that particular symptom varies from person to person, so I wanted to know about others' experiences with those classes of antidepressants and if symptoms varied from drug to drug, even within the same class.",1

"Last night was hard. Harder than the rest. I won't lie, all my feelings of death were enhanced when I saw that my e√ó, my first and only love, have the time of his life with someone else. I was drunk and sure I wanted to die. So I told a friend and she was sad, but I reassured her I wasnt going to do anything. When I went home to my apartment, I took a handful of ibuprofen pills and went to sleep. I probably should have taken more because I'm awake typing this. I know it's stupid to think I could overdose on ibuprofen, but I didn't have anything else. I'm so disappointed that I woke up this morning and saw a text from me ex, essentially saying that he has been over me for almost a year and that he was happy now and he was over it. Him telling me to get over it. The reason I want to die isn't because of him. However, knowing that whatever feelings I felt of love were unrequited, just makes me wish I wasn't alive to see it. I wish it was my last message. I wish it worked somehow. I'm just so tired of living my life, but there's no real way to end it. I'm trapped. Every attempt gets me closer to my goal, but I'm too afraid to do it. Life is so tiring and I can't keep pretending to everyone that I plan on being alive next fall.",0

"Every single night it's been so hard just to exist and breathe and I have desperately wanted to end my life. Tonight I let my dog out and I saw a package on my doorstep and it was from a couple of friends that I haven't spoken to in a couple months who were worried about me. A bunch of doctor who stuff and star trek socks, literally everything that I would love. I cried when I opened it. I become so convinced that I'm worthless and I'm horrible to be around and I stop talking with people who actually care about me. I called them instantly and they weren't even mad that I haven't talked to them in so long. I wish I could tell them how much it means to me but I'm afraid to let people know that I've been suicidal because I don't want them to be worried. I'm actually smiling right now, probably the happiest I've been in weeks. Sometimes I think things happen for a reason.",1
"I've been in a funk for a long time and it's just not getting any better. I'm really struggling with literally everything right now. My family is no help. I lost one of my jobs because the place closed and so I'm having to burn through my savings to cover everything. Last month, I was struggling with coming up with my rent money and my prescriptions. This month I've got the rent covered but now don't have enough money for the power bill, my car payment, and my car insurance ad again I'm left panicking and stressing about where I'm going to get the money and what's going to happen. I'm starting a new job in three weeks but that doesn't help me right now. It's so depressing and I honestly feel like killing myself sometimes over it. I wake up dreading what the day holds and it's horrible. My parents don't believe me when I tell them I'm depressed and won't help me with money because they think I should learn through struggling. Everything with them just adds to my state of mind. sorry for ranting and getting dark, but it's just horrible to feel like this. I feel so lost and alone.",0

By extension, leeching off the few that know and care for me. Maybe I'll die in my sleep tonight. I'd love that. This sounds pretty edgy. I used to feel edgy, now I don't feel. Not that I miss it.",1
"I've lost everything. I fucked up my entire life and it's all my doing. Terrible people like me should not stay alive. I lost my relationship with a wondeful person who I treated terribly, my home, my family, my friends, my job, my car, EVERYTHING. Everything I owned was in my car and it got towed while I was living in that car just trying to get back on my feet. And I can't afford to get my car back. Now I'm on the streets and I have no one. Not even my family wants to help anymore. And who can blame them? I have been nothing but a complete disappointment to everyone who has ever had love for and showed me kindness. I have hurt and betrayed everyone in my life. I even did an analysis of my life last night and I realized that I have NEVER succeeded in ANYTHING. I have failed at absolutely everything in my life. I couldn't even finish high school. I'm a complete and total failure. Only thing that has kept me from ending it all is that I'm only 22, so I feel like maybe things could get better until I remembered that I'm most likely going to fucking JAIL because I couldn't take the classes that court appointed me to take. My life is so fucked. I'm so close to just hanging myself or jumping in front of a fucking train.",1
"I know we use the word ""burden"" a lot. I do it too. There's more to it than that. I have family members who have been affected by my problems. If I go away, it will hurt them, but one last time instead of multiple episodes. That's it in a nutshell. Most people don't want me around. I'm not desirable in any way. I'm not exciting. What I have to offer other people, like kindness, love, compassion, are outdated concepts. They don't want these things and they can't give them in return. I don't belong anywhere so I'd be better off going to nowhere.",1

This year one. All. Because of stupid UC. I hate myself, I hate how I look. I don't feel any support or love from anyone in my life except my little daughter. She's the only reason I don't commit suicide. I don't have strength anymore. There are plans to have 3 surgeries in near future. One of them is gastric sleeve - because I can't get rid of the weight because if the medicine I use, I feel ugly and fat. I miss the lovely feeling u get from first kisses, from love, excitement, happiness. It's just... My life is dark rn. I think about suicide alot, I've told my husband, mom (who doesn't belive clinical depression is a real thing), my therapist (who has a hard time with me, because I'm a stubborn little Satan). I don't know what to do... I know where I can get sleeping pills, so I'm just afraid my daughter will loose her mother soon. And I'm in Norway, I'm afraid of telling doctors about my suicide thoughts because here they are really happy to take away child from your family for every little shit. I don't know what to do.

Sure, I‚Äôll be missing graduation and prom and all those super important high school things... but at this point I don‚Äôt care. I see no point in continuing to live.

"I really don't know if this is the appropriate sub-reddit for this but I find it really funny when I become suicidal. The intent to kill myself is very strong and it reaches the point that it creates a heavy feeling in my brain and renders my progress with my mental health null. I am quite aware of the progress I made the past few months and I have even considered myself depression-free until I had an episode after feeling very stable for three weeks. I realized that depression isn't a one-time thing that can be cured with constant means of pharmacology. I am now in this state of wanting to kill myself (again) but is too lazy to get a knife downstairs. I would know damn well that this feeling of emptiness and being suicidal will subside after this episode. Any tips to overcome this recursive state of mine? However, I might break out of this laziness phase and actually do it.",0

Got divorced, thrown out the flat, a whole lot of lawyer bullshit, and a lot more negative thoughts. Basically haven't been truly happy since then, and as things are turning into shit again, I am feeling that these suicidal thoughts are slowly finding their way back to me. I am on meds and seeking professional help, but I still feel very lost most of the time, feels like I am failing at every little thing I do, turning away from people I adore and not being fair to them, often feels like I am being torn apart form the inside and I am very surely getting sick of it. I've been depressed for as long as I can think of, not sure if I can hold it together for much longer. Feels like a rant, perhaps that'll help. Thank you for the attention and time.",0

I‚Äôve been in a serious depressive episode for a couple months and I‚Äôve always been able to say ‚Äúat least I do good in school‚Äù. I need to do good so I can go to a good university after I graduate from this shitty community college and after studying my ass off I thought I actually did well on my midterms but I just barely scraped by. I can‚Äôt get over how awful I feel and I know I‚Äôm overreacting. I know it‚Äôs not the end of the world and I can improve my grades but I feel like a fucking idiot who cannot do anything right and I know all of my professors are probably laughing at how terrible my tests were. All I want to do is cut myself and lay in bed during spring break because I don‚Äôt deserve to do anything else. Why can‚Äôt I just think rationally about this shit instead of blowing it out of proportion? It‚Äôs probably my autism coming through. I told myself it would get better. It‚Äôs not.

All my friends and family are so confused by my increasingly poor life decisions lately and I never have a good excuse. What am I supposed to tell them? That I‚Äôm so upset that it feels impossible to prioritize even the most important tasks. That I feel so lost that I don‚Äôt give a fuck about the future consequences because of how much pain I‚Äôm in now? And why I don‚Äôt bother telling anyone? Why I just keep it to myself and don‚Äôt even want to use the word depression to describe myself? Because I honestly feel like a little entitled bitch trying to use mental health as an excuse for being lazy but I truthfully have not been content with anything in my life for the past 3 years and it feels like there‚Äôs no escape from my mind. I‚Äôve fantasized my suicide several times a day everyday for the last few months even though I have no plans of doing so. It gives me disturbing comfort. It makes me feel justified for making such a mess of my life. I once truly considered myself depressed. But now I don‚Äôt consider myself depressed I don‚Äôt think. There is no longer a root to my problems. I feel utterly broken.,0

That's why I always delay things, even though I have to do it at that time. The worst part is that I'm aware of this situation, and I'm still not doing anything about it. Time's going too fast and idk what to do. My anxiety gets worse at times like this and when it gets worse, I can't even sleep, let alone do anything. I'm so tired of feeling this way, but like I said, I don't know what to do. I don't have anyone to talk to and I really need advice.

It‚Äôs a college town so every job is a competition with like 20,000 students. I don‚Äôt know what the fuck to do anymore. I miss being able to go out and do things. Or even just handle my own problems as they come up. My snake had to go to the vet and I had to call and ask my grandparents to loan me money. Its so depressing. I just paid rent and now I have $20.

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm actually depressed, or going through that ‚Äòedgy teen phase‚Äô. I‚Äôm too scared to get it diagnosed, as I‚Äôm too afraid of what the results might say. I‚Äôve told my dad around 2~3 months ago about how I felt, but I don‚Äôt think he really cared. We basically had a small chat, and that was all.

"I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression right now and I have been taking prescription meds for the last couple weeks. It really helps! A little background- I got out of a 6 year relationship due to not seeing a future with my ex in December 2019. And then one person who I thought was really close friend of mine, decided he did not want to be friends with me anymore and cut all contacts with me. I get emotionally attached wayyy too easily and this led to me having anxiety, panic attacks and depression - which eventually led to insomnia, IBS, migraines and constant body aches. I started therapy in feb 2020 and have been since going to my therapist every week. And my therapist suggested I look at options for medication and try it. So since the last 2 weeks, I‚Äôm on Lexapro (SSRI) and my psychiatrist did tell me that it is going to take a few weeks to see changes. But for the last 3/4 days I have been observing that my energy levels have increased because I have been able to sleep well and it is so much better. My IBS has decreased and I haven‚Äôt got any migraines. I‚Äôm really really glad the medication is helping.

"Ok so I suffer with seasonal depression, and this winter has been significantly worse than last. Last winter I was around friends, and family. I was at home. This year I'm in a new city. I moved last summer for university, to try and get away from what/who I once was. I have met some amazing people here, but nobody seems to have any time to care for me. Heres a quick rundown of my 2020 so far: I got a shoulder injury, had time out of the gym, was unable to compete because I was too weak. My girlfriend of 2.5 years and I split up. I developed a drug addiction to cope with the pain. I've hated my body more than ever and have lost all appetite and stopped eating. Sex drive has plummeted. Started hooking up with a girl but couldnt maintain an erection- realised I was using her for hugs and kisses to numb the feeling of loneliness. I want to go to a doctor but my brain keeps telling me I'm feeling sorry for myself and this is all for attention. I even feel like this writing this post. I hate myself and genuinely don't want to die but I can't see any other options. I just want someone to love me",1
Today I came home and was excited to play a video game. But it just...didn't feel right. I felt like I hadn't played it in a long time even though I played yesterday. I felt like I did when I was a kid and really sad over the summer doing nothing all day. I felt really weird. Anyone else experience this?,0

Even dressing myself is hard and my partner has to help me sometimes. Lately in therapy I have been learning about how depression impacts the brain. I have been learning about how it impacts concentration and memory. Well, I experienced that completely yesterday. Yesterday I took a shower. It was my first shower in a few days. I was dreading it because it seems so hard now. I know it sounds stupid but it just freaking is. Anyway, I was going through the motions but felt so out of it. I completely forgot to wash my hair.

I've been wanting to cut myself so badly again too, maybe just deep enough to make me feel like I'll actually accomplish something worthwhile for once. Pretty sure the only thing stopping me from doing that is my boyfriend and we've even been at each others throats a bit recently. I dunno. I almost feel like just ending it all now before my life takes another turn for the worse because it 100% will. I just wanna die and be at peace for once in my life.

I feel guilty because I know I‚Äôd worry everyone because of course they don‚Äôt want me to die, if they care about me or not they don‚Äôt want somebody to kill themselves regardless.

"I really do not understand why I am isolated for ""coming across"" a certain way. People will judge you based off your innate defense mechanisms, but then the next day, it's like when I hit reset and try again to get to know someone, I can't. I'm a permanent smear of my mistakes. (I'm human, others aren't I guess?) I guess depression has made me ""unapproachable"". Which I don't grasp, because I am constantly in the presence of people who treat me like dirt (which obviously puts me in the offensive). A lot of people around me also get defended by their friends when they face trials, I.E. ""they're having a hard time, just try to understand them"". But I get told to change. As if I don't deal with my own? It makes no sense. Does anyone else do this? Face isolation because people misunderstand their emotional turmoil?

I just want them to know I love them so much, I can‚Äôt even describe how much I love them, and I‚Äôm so sorry for what I‚Äôm doing, what I am feeling, what I am going to do in the future, I would love to change but I can‚Äôt.

It hurts..but I remembered the feelings I had last time I went and saw you. It hurt..I cried myself to sleep. I went to bed hurting and I woke up hurting. Once again I‚Äôm left looking dumb to go out of my way to see you. I crossed many busy roads and climbed many tall mountains to just try and please you and I still believe you truly don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs hard letting go of the one person that once made you the happiest you had ever been in life. Looking back at when I had you I looked so different. I literally had a glow within me. You gave me that glow that made me shine so bright..you also took it away without any hesitation. I‚Äôve never been the same since then. I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôve kept you around for 2 more years after we broke up. I know deep down you will never be able to make me shine like you used to..I will never have that glow again. I will never be able to feel that love again..and it simple as to why not..because you don‚Äôt love me..you don‚Äôt care about me..It‚Äôs funny how life works. How the people you would do anything for in this world will do nothing for you. How the ones that once made you so happy now bring darkness into your life. When will one day someone fight for me..fight to keep me seeing me glow...fight to keep me happy..Hopefully soon..but for now as I wait I‚Äôve decided to not cross any busy roads for you or climb any mountains..for now I will stay here even though it hurts I‚Äôm safer here by myself than with you.,0

"I had an open cosmetic rhinoplasty 4 months ago and since then I've been experiencing symptoms that have been fairly debilitating for me. A few weeks post-op I noticed that my air flow was different in each nostril and there was a slight pain in my left but I chalked it up to swelling. Now, 4 months later there is no more pain but I feel like there is a blockage in my left nostril and I can't sense airflow at all in either nostril which is keeping me up at night. I'm on sleeping pills which is barely helping me get a few hours throughout the night. I'm really scared and did not expect to go through this scary journey - all I wanted was a refinement. How would I know if I have empty nose syndrome or if I should wait longer to see if my issues are resolved naturally? Please help anyone who has gone through something similar or knows someone who has gotten better as I've become a shell of myself.. going from perfect breathing to feeling like I'm walking around with a bag over my head all day is devastating and the real kicker is I'm not even happy with the cosmetic result but at this point I just want to breathe again,,,",0

"Yesterdays brawl is enough for me. Just another reason to do it, and to be honest main reason of all the bad things happening, it's better to be abandoned, rather than have a ""family"" like that, if you can even call 1 parent that hates you, and blames for everything, a ""family"". I must admit, it felt good to say what I said, and do what I did. It feels so good to know it's soon to be over, I fear death, and pain, but the peace that comes afterwards is what I have been waiting all my life, honest smile.

Its not really bad, i just do stabbing motions on myself, but the point is i consider doing that normal. I also keep daydreaming while walking and oddly enough i daydream about me getting in a car crash or something similar, which i has a high chance of happening considering im daydreaming.

"i just want to leave this world. i‚Äôm tired of being told that i‚Äôm no help, tired of feeling guilt and shame. i don‚Äôt want my mother and brother to feel the overwhelming feelings of sadness though. i don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. there‚Äôs no one to turn to, nothing left to do in this miserable life.",0
"I have been struggling a great deal lately. I suffered an injury and then had to have surgery and then suffered complications. I continue to be in pain everyday. Since the injury happened at work, I was forced to resign my position in order to get a worker's comp settlement. I used the money to pay rent and bills and medical expenses but now it's gone. I have been looking for work since November. And I mean really looking. Every single day. I have had several interviews, but literally have been told multiple times that I was their second choice I am completely out of money. I am almost out of food. All of my utilities are so far behind, every day I expect them to be turned off. I have received a 3 day notice for my rent. I an about to be homeless. I do not have any family. I have been sick for so log now, I have very few friends left. I have tried every agency that I can for help and I an repeatedly turned away because they don't have the funds to help me. And they say even if they did, what about next month? They are right. There is no point.",0
Everyone at work is against each other. I‚Äôve been trying to be a happy medium for weeks and it‚Äôs all turned to shit. I‚Äôm tired of it. I ready for peace again. Peace = you know,0
"I took some time off from college to chill out myself, but I need money. I feel lost that I can't fucking find a job. All the interviews that I got, I was rejected.",1
Can I just rant? Can I just post that people do not seem to even want to connect with other people today? My goodness how I have reached out for help with no one responding. YET my cats are coddling me like no tomorrow because they can sense something is up?! What is wrong with us as human beings? Are we really that afraid of connection?,0
"Can't shake the thoughts. Sometimes I just go outside at night and look at the moon, hoping that she's lookin too. Anything to convince myself there's still some connection. No need to respond just getting thoughts out of my head. It helps a bit.",0
I dont think there's any original part about me I am just a patch work of other people over what‚Äôs there to make it seem interesting Just a bunch of tacky patches on a worn out denim jacket,1
"These days I don't feel anything to do. I feel completely empty. I still remember I used to enjoy music, having a time in terrace, enjoying the wind and climate. I think I have depression.",0
I don't wanna live like this. I'm typing as I'm sobbing cause it's just hit me that it won't ever get any better. This is it for me. I promised myself that I would hold on until I could leave my family in a better financially. Until my grandma passed away so I couldn't save her up the pain. But I'm suffering so much. No one fucking likes me. And I don't say anything but god it hurts. It hurts being alone. It hurts being rejected. I've tried to keep going. And perhaps tomorrow I'll wake up and go to work like nothing happened. But tonight I wanna pretend I'm dying. That when I fall asleep it'll be the last time I see this fucking planet. That when I wake up I won't remember anything. I'll be free.,0
I have a reoccurring day dream where I have to grab all my belongings and food and live in a room in my house for the rest of my life and I find it very hard to snap out of it. Normally it's the bathroom because it's the smallest room and my brain hates me. Even when I type this I get a boost of happy from my brain to tell me I'm a fucking liar idiot but if I delete it I would feel even stupider for wasting my time so I'm going to post it anyway.,1
"I'm 38 and always felt like a screw up. I'm one of those people that when things start looking good, I'll always fund a way to mess it up and end up back at square one. I'm constantly down and always thinking about ending my life, like every day. All that's holding me back is the thought of leaving my 2 young kids, but it also depresses me more knowing how much of a loser their dad is. I've tried 3 overdoses with Zopiclone which did nothing but I have been practicing with hanging while sitting, I came close to passing out 3 days ago with belt in door but fought to save myself as I knew mrs and kids were due home. I cant shake the thoughts. Debt + gambling addiction + pure unhappy",0
"I just can not keep doing this anymore. I keep reaching out for help, doctors push pills on me (I'm on five now) and therapists just try to push me into blaming my dead father. I can't afford my home. I can't afford my bills. I can't afford food and even the subreddits that claim to offer help just delete my posts because I lurk and my account doesn't have hundreds of karma. I do not know what to do. I cry constantly. I hate my life and myself. I can't sleep I can't eat. I try to open up to people and they look at me like a monster. I am a monster. I'm about to lose my home and I have nothing left to sell to try to hang on to it. I sold all my dads belongings to make ends meet, he left those to me so I could have a good fun life and here I am a piece of garbage who can't even work a part time job to buy groceries. The state turns me away because I have income ($944/mo in disability). I'm done. I can't do this. Why am I fighting? For who? I'm alone. My chest hurts, my eyes hurts. My head spins and I do not even know if any of this makes sense. I just can't keep this up. I have been fighting since I was a child, I'm a 38 year old man (ha) now. What do I have to offer to this world? All I am is a leech. I have no skills. I was never good in school because of my mental illness and no one would diagnose it. I hate myself and so does the world. I'll never be more than this.",1
"I feel really worthless because The only thing keeping me alive is a video game coming out in 15 days (DOOM eternal) and it won't even last for long. I've been told to tell CAHMS if anything is bothering me but anxiety tells me no. I'm considering jumping off the only skyscraper in my city when I finish the game because there will nothing else to make me happy. I'm just glad that there is something in the world that will make me happy, that is only for a short while though",1
"I'm freaking out. I feel so empty and worthless and depressed. I don't have insurance so I called the er to see how much it would cost. They told me to call some office between 8-5 on the weekdays to find out, so idk. I dont wanna hear call the helpline, because I've called several and no one gives a shit and they really dont help. I'm looking to just getting drunk enough to the point where killing myself wont be so scary to do. I'm really fucking lost. I'm fucking done.",1
"I got way too attached and when she ghosted me I wanted to hate her, but I couldn‚Äôt. So I hated myself. At one point the only thing holding me back was the thought of living if I failed. Fast forward a year out of no where she attempts suicide. It made me realize how much I still cared about her. I don‚Äôt feel like I deserve to be as broken down as I am though. I cared so much about her and she probably didn‚Äôt even think of me for a moment. I was just another stupid dude to her. Everything about it is fueling my self hatred.",1
"Just a little insight about my life 3 years ago I lost the last vehicle I would ever own 3 years ago I lost the I only place i had to live Ive lost at least 2-3 jobs in a 3 year span 2 years ago I lost the girl i loved 1 year ago I lost a career I was failing in 6 months ago i was eating good, showering daily I got a job and started fixing my life made plans fo get another car pay some debt Today I am jobless, homeless, hungry don‚Äôt shower often dont eat much, isolate my self Because I miss life.

I had posted a little while ago but honestly I feel like this applies to me now. I dont trust myself and I‚Äôm scared and I cannot talk to my parents but I don‚Äôt wanna call the hotline because I dont wanna go back to the hospital. I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm scared,0
"As an individual who is friends with or have family members that suffer from depression, Ive always wondered, what is something that can help depression that a therapist is lacking? From my personal experience, Ive always heard that having a therapist to treat your depression can be helpful sometimes but many times, from what I hear, the patient continues to suffer from depression. What is something that others can do to help a victim of depression? From your personal experience, what do you believe could be extremely helpful when treating or helping those with depression? I am genuinely curious and eager for ANY feedback due to my desire of assisting others.",0
"My bedroom and bathroom look like a hurricane struck them and I can‚Äôt even eat normally, if at all. I can barely move. That‚Äôs not an exaggeration, just doing simple tasks feels like agony. I haven‚Äôt self-harmed in almost a year, yet I feel like relapsing. I just want to give myself alcohol poisoning or jump off of a bridge over an interstate. I feel like a burden on my fiance. I know he loves me and that he‚Äôs concerned but he has his own problems and I‚Äôm only adding to his. I don‚Äôt recognize myself anymore. I don‚Äôt know who the fuck I am. I dread the future. Watching my boomer parents suffer from addiction, depression and loneliness and struggle to afford retirement doesn‚Äôt give me high hopes. I despise the fucking world. I want no part of any of this cruel, selfish, violent, disgusting place. I don‚Äôt have the energy to partake in this rat race just to survive. If you‚Äôve read this far, thanks for taking the time. Sometimes all someone needs is to vent and not hold back their real thoughts and feelings.",0
"Welp, just got done with another batch of doctors visits and the results are in, I will be crippled for the rest of my life. But that's not what bothers me, I've had plenty of time to come to terms with my condition and the affect it will have on my quality of life and my life expectancy. What bothers me is the soul crushing loneliness, I havent had a girlfriend in years and I haven't been physically touched in what seems like forever. I spend all day in a shitty little side room by myself writing and hardly see hide nor hair of another person besides my dad most of the time. I'm pretty done with it all to be honest, I don't really see any reason to continue living like this.",0
"If someone can give me a link that would be nice. I might fit in more or i can talk to other people, I don't know.",0
Fuck everything I‚Äôve worked so hard and prayed so much and it‚Äôs all still going so bad. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore I cannot even wake up without crying I hate this,0
"Recently, im going through a severe depressive episode and I did some things I would not have otherwise done that are now affecting my mental health further and affecting someone I love. I would like to hear those with severe depression talk about whether they feel they have the ability to consent and make decisions on sensitive matters during severe depressive episodes. It feels like society tells everyone that it is their fault if they make a bad decision, that they are responsible for their choices, and most dont understand mental illness properly and to me its not that black and white. I want to know whether you think you truly have the capacity to be at fault for a decision youve made if it is something you would not have done outside an acute depressive episode. Four abilities are usually assessed with decision making when I was looking around. The only studies I found were for research purposes (which saddens me, but thats a whole other topic). The four abilities: Understanding Appreciating Reasoning Ability to express a choice Now I cant say I know the exact ways to interpet these 4 things right now without further research but, do you feel you possess these abilities during a severe depressive episode? Do you possess some and not others? Does it vary? My answer would be during a severe depressive episode, I do not possess any of these reliably at every moment. It is not consistent enough for me to able to say I possess any of them during these times. Thank you for reading ‚ô°",0
One of my best friends recently lost a friend to suicide &amp; it is rlly affecting his mental health. I never met his friend but he seemed like a great guy.

"I just turned 20 and am beginning college this year since I have not had money for it and I don‚Äôt count with my moms support in any way. Last year a lot of things happened that made me spiral into a terrible depression and lost my job because of it. Since then things have just progressively gotten worse and I can‚Äôt find a new job. Where I live there isn‚Äôt much places to work at since it‚Äôs a small town yet I can‚Äôt seem to find in one place. It makes me super sad to see that everyone is doing fine while I am doing nothing with my life and it makes me feel like a failure. I know I could be doing so much better and greater things but I just don‚Äôt know where to start. I wish I had my moms support like other kids do but it‚Äôs not the case and I have to do things on my own, but I feel like everything is a giant and I am a speck of dust, what can I do to better my situation or feel better and more positive about it?",1
I was getting better... until I ruined everything. Now everyone hates me. I have nobody to turn to until my therapy appointment on Saturday...it‚Äôs too far away...how am I supposed to show my face in school tomorrow when even my best friends hate me now? I‚Äôm failing chemistry. My teachers a pervert. I want to die soon. I‚Äôm done.,0
"I think of myself as a spiritual person. I also think of myself of not ever belonging in this world. I don‚Äôt understand why I was even born and placed into a life where I would be met with great obstacles. People, even family have been against me. I just want to go back to wherever my soul came from. I‚Äôm so tired. I‚Äôm so exhausted with life. I dont want to live anymore.",0
Every night it‚Äôs ‚Äúyou guys want ice cream?‚Äù After dinner. Everyone turned him down so he just got an ice cream sandwich for himself. Tonight he stared at me and made sucking noises while eating his ice cream sandwich. I got up and left the room and watched the game alone. I‚Äôm tired of my dad being a pervert and my mom being oblivious or pretending not to notice. Their marriage is over anyway so she doesn‚Äôt give a shit. I‚Äôve talked to her about it and she just acted clueless and said she‚Äôd keep an eye out and then never spoke of it again. I just have to move out and be alone.,0
"I would like to say that I was shook, but I knew she has the habit of consuming a lot of sleeping pills just for not having to deal with the daily problems... Aside from trying get professional help I dont really know what to do, I feel guilty about this",0
"I can't take this anymore. I've been wanting to buy a pocket pistol or similar weapon to off myself with for the past few days now, and I've been doing the research. I live in SE Michigan, drive for money (can't afford a living), and have been studying to get a certification for IT so I can maybe get a job at a geek squad. Also been looking at getting a job as a Pharmacy tech. Yes, my dad is autistic, so I may not consume the media that you do, but I assure you I will be far from a burden in your life, if you so choose to... adopt me... I'm running out of steam and ideas, and I refuse to let myself become a burnout when I had nothing but good intentions.",0
I feel like people are controlling every aspect of my life. My anxiety is so severe I can‚Äôt leave the house and all I want to do is find a way to end it. Can someone help me find an easy way out?,0
